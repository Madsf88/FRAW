Navigate to the Tools screen in your WordPress backend to get started (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31373">#31373</a>). </li>\n<li><strong>Browsing and switching installed themes</strong> has been added to the Customizer to make switching faster and more convenient.

Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5809/">#5809</a>).</li>\n<li>New <code>wp.a11y.speak()</code> functionality helps your JavaScript talk to screen readers to better inform impaired users what&#8217;s happening on-screen. Try it out in your plugin or theme and let us know if you notice any adverse affects (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31368/">#31368</a>).</li>\n<li>Named clause support has been added to <code>WP_Query</code>, <code>WP_Comment_Query</code>, and <code>WP_User_Query</code>, allowing specific <code>meta_query</code> clauses to be used with <code>orderby</code>. If you have any complex queries, please test them (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31045/">#31045</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31265/">#31265</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.2, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">check out the weekly review posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

This was reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnonen</a>. This issue does not affect version 4.0, but version 4.0.1 does address these eight security issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three cross-site scripting issues that a contributor or author could use to compromise a site. Discovered by <a href="http://joncave.co.uk/">Jon Cave</a>, <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, and <a href="https://johnblackbourn.com/">John Blackbourn</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>\n<li>A cross-site request forgery that could be used to trick a user into changing their password.</li>\n<li>An issue that could lead to a denial of service when passwords are checked. Reported by <a href="http://www.behindthefirewalls.com/">Javier Nieto Arevalo</a> and <a href="http://www.devconsole.info/">Andres Rojas Guerrero</a>.</li>\n<li>Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests. Reported by Ben Bidner (vortfu).</li>\n<li>An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user&#8217;s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven&#8217;t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding). Reported by <a href="http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk">David Anderson</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported separately by <a href="https://twitter.com/MomenBassel">Momen Bassel</a>, <a href="http://c0dehouse.blogspot.in/">Tanoy Bose</a>, and <a href="https://managewp.com/">Bojan Slavković of ManageWP</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 4.0.1 also fixes 23 bugs with 4.0, and we&#8217;ve made two hardening changes, including better validation of EXIF data we are extracting from uploaded photos.

Its inclusion means that millions of WordPress sites will now have free access to protection against brute force attacks, making a large portion of the web more secure.</p>\n<p>With the addition of Protect, the plugin has grown to include 36 modules, which can be a bit overwhelming for new users. Jetpack 3.4 introduces a new &#8220;Jump Start&#8221; feature that will activate a curated set of modules to get you started.

Behind all of these crunchy snacks is a busy hive of designers and project managers who require a robust system for working together on creative projects.</p>\n<p>Last year, Frito-Lay approached <a href="http://liftux.com/" target="_blank">Lift</a>, a WordPress design and development agency, to create a custom project management/proofing app for its creative team. Lift opted to <a href="http://liftux.com/portfolio/frito-lay-creative-project-management-app/" target="_blank">build the app using WordPress as a base</a>. The result is a completely customized admin experience tailored to fit Frito-Lay&#8217;s workflow like a glove.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-showcase.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40423]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-showcase.jpg?resize=1025%2C918" alt="frito-lay-showcase" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40787" /></a></p>\n<h3>Under the Hood of the App</h3>\n<p>The project management app melds a collection of plugins with an accompanying theme to deliver the necessary user roles, custom fields, notifications/updates, and upload management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a custom theme that includes modifications to the WordPress admin and force redirects users to sign in if they attempt to visit a page that typically would appear on the front-end,&#8221; Lift Partner <a href="https://twitter.com/chriswallace" target="_blank">Chris Wallace</a> said. His team used a number of plugins to customize the admin, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> by Elliot Condon</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a> by Justin Tadlock</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/" target="_blank">Stream</a> (the pre-cloud based version) by X-Team</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 and Cloudfront</a> by Brad Touesnard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lift implemented the custom admin design as part of the theme. They built it in such a way that the client will be able to keep pace with WordPress core and plugin updates without breaking the app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We tried to keep major UI changes to a minimum and focus on building the UI with Advanced Custom Fields wherever we needed that level of customization,&#8221; Wallace said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a few custom UI elements but they are styled and managed through our custom theme, so updated plugins and WordPress Core shouldn&#8217;t ever really break those things as long as major actions and filters remain in place.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-ui-elements.png" rel="prettyphoto[40423]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-ui-elements.png?resize=1020%2C495" alt="frito-lay-ui-elements" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40807" /></a></p>\n<p>Lift customized the project workflow for Frito-Lay using new workflows based on post statuses, modeled after the way <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/" target="_blank">Edit Flow</a> manages the editorial process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When projects are updated, we check for a certain status and send out update emails to whoever needs to be notified for certain stages of the project,&#8221; Wallace said. &#8220;Additionally, we swapped the &#8216;publish&#8217; metabox out for a custom one based on our status updates, allowing us to easily show the state of the project and change the UI as necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Why Use WordPress Instead of Basecamp?</h3>\n<p>You might be wondering why Frito-Lay would opt to build its own project management app when something like Basecamp already exists with similar features.</p>\n<p>Basecamp&#8217;s top pricing tier is $3K per year and has a maximum storage limit of 500GB. That limit could be used up fairly quickly while managing design projects, which often require passing large files back and forth between team members.</p>\n<p>Instead, Frito-Lay stores all of its data on Amazon, which allows the team to organize files exactly how it needs them. Building a custom project management app preserves the team&#8217;s established workflow. They never have to worry about running out of space and can always modify the app&#8217;s behavior if necessary in the future.</p>\n<p>Wallace said that it&#8217;s not uncommon for Lift to receive requests from companies that prefer to build their own custom software, instead of going with a SaaS provider. In many cases, building a custom solution is more cost effective for the client in the long run.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the projects we&#8217;ve done recently have been for television networks and news organizations but we do receive frequent requests to modify workflows in the WordPress admin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would say most of our work involves theme design but there are definitely clients who need plugins that add or modify the admin one way or another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress proved to be a strong option for Frito-Lay, Wallace and the Lift team don&#8217;t always pitch the platform for their projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It just so happens that it is a good fit for many of the projects we are presented with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think for most website projects nowadays, clients just need something familiar, fast, and easy to use and WordPress typically fits in with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lift is currently building more projects with AngularJS using the WordPress REST API to create more customized app-like solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the ability to create WordPress-powered apps in Javascript is a big step forward for WordPress,&#8221; Wallace said. &#8220;It allows you to create and manage a number of apps that can interact with a single WordPress site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Building custom apps for clients doesn&#8217;t always mean starting from scratch. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve gotten to the point where WordPress has proven to be highly stable, scalable, fast, and easy-to-use,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need advice, there are a bunch of local meetups and online groups dedicated to WP, an advantage which is lacking in some of the smaller CMS tools out there. Community is everything.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 16:27:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Matt: Chosen as Young Global Leader";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44864";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"http://ma.tt/2015/03/chosen-as-young-global-leader/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:457:"<p>I&#8217;m very honored to be chosen as part of the<br />\nWorld Economic Forum&#8217;s <a href="http://widgets.weforum.org/ygl-2015/04.html">Young Global Leaders class of 2015</a> alongside some really amazing folks.

For more than half of the attendees, this was their first WordCamp. With <a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/">four tracks</a> going on at the same time, attendees had plenty of opportunities to learn.</p>\n<h2>Great WiFi</h2>\n<p>As to be expected, WiFi coverage was great throughout the event. I didn&#8217;t hear anyone complain about connection problems or speed. In my experience, WordCamps held on college campuses usually have great speed and are built to handle a large number of concurrent connections. WordCamp St. Louis was no exception.</p>\n<h2>Crowded Classrooms</h2>\n<p>Outside of a few sessions and keynotes in the main auditorium, sessions were held in classrooms that can fit 20-30 people comfortably. Some sessions were more popular than others where there was standing and sitting room only. Not only did some attendees have to sit on the floor or stand up during the session, it caused the room&#8217;s temperature to significantly increase.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WCStLouisWPSecuritySession.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40776]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40777" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WCStLouisWPSecuritySession.jpg?resize=1024%2C768" alt="Standing and Sitting Room Only to Learn WP Security" /></a>Standing and Sitting Room Only to Learn WP Security\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to predict how popular a given session is going to be without some sort of survey before hand. I hope the organizing team sends out a post event survey to find out which sessions were the most popular so they can assign them to larger rooms next year.</p>\n<h2>My Favorite Session</h2>\n<p>My favorite session was by <a title="http://sara-cannon.com/" href="http://sara-cannon.com/">Sara Cannon</a> on the <a title="stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/wordpress-and-user-experience/" href="http://wptavern.com/stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/wordpress-and-user-experience/">WordPress User Experience</a> and how it can be improved. She shared a number of plugins to improve the user experience for publishers, site owners, and content creators.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SaraCannonWCStLouis.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40776]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40780" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SaraCannonWCStLouis.jpg?resize=1024%2C768" alt="Sara Cannon at WordCamp St. Louis" /></a>Sara Cannon at WordCamp St. Louis\n<p>Some of the plugins mentioned include <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/">Simple Page Ordering</a>, <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-column/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-column/">Featured Image Column</a>, and <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/drag-drop-featured-image/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/drag-drop-featured-image/">Drag and Drop Featured Image</a>.

Russell Fair, Chris Koerner, Lucas Lima, and Eric Juden taught them the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is WordPress?</li>\n<li>How is it being used?</li>\n<li>Let’s create our blog! (using a free account on wordpress.com)</li>\n<li>How to add new posts and pages</li>\n<li>How to add multimedia (photos, video)</li>\n<li>Talk about privacy and security</li>\n<li>Copyright and fair use</li>\n<li>Free and open source software (like WordPress!)</li>\n<li>Talk about the public nature of the web.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/KidsCampStLouis.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40776]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40781" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/KidsCampStLouis.jpg?resize=1024%2C768" alt="KidsCamp St. Louis 2015" /></a>KidsCamp St. Louis 2015\n<p>Based on my observations, the children did well. One child in particular noticed that the admin bar looked similar to the top navigation bar provided by the theme and asked how to remove it. There were few questions asked as the children picked up on WordPress rather quickly.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, KidsCamp touched on copyright law and explained the public nature of the web. I didn&#8217;t interview any of the children to find out what they thought about the class, but I&#8217;m happy to see these subjects taught at an early age. I hope other WordCamps adopt a similar strategy.</p>\n<p>I spoke to a woman who was with her husband and son who has a business built on WordPress. Not only was she thrilled with KidsCamp, but she loved that there was time to learn WordPress as a family.</p>\n<h2>Contributor Day</h2>\n<p>On the second day of WordCamp, one of the day long sessions focused on <a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/give-back-to-core-2/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/give-back-to-core-2/">contributing back to WordPress</a>. There were sessions on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/">updating documentation</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/">helping the theme review team</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/">answering questions</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/">providing new designs</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/">hosting a local WordPress-related event</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">contributing code to WordPress</a>.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/KonstantinObenlandWCStLouis2015.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40776]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40782" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/KonstantinObenlandWCStLouis2015.jpg?resize=1024%2C768" alt="Q&A With Konstantin Obenland" /></a>Q&amp;A With Konstantin Obenland\n<p><a title="https://twitter.com/obenland" href="https://twitter.com/obenland">Konstantin Obenland</a> did a 45 minute session where anyone in the room could ask him a question on topics related to WordPress core. <a title="https://pippinsplugins.com/" href="https://pippinsplugins.com/">Pippin Williamson</a> gave a demonstration on <a title="http://wptavern.com/how-to-adopt-a-plugin-or-put-it-up-for-adoption" href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-adopt-a-plugin-or-put-it-up-for-adoption">how to put a plugin up for adoption</a> and showed the audience how he reviews plugins before they&#8217;re approved to be on the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">official plugin directory</a>.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Value</h2>\n<p>Overall, WordCamp St. Louis was a great event. There were plenty of volunteers to help guide people around, something that is a necessity when multiple tracks, floors, and classrooms are involved. The catered food was excellent and the after party held at <a title="http://www.citymuseum.org/" href="http://www.citymuseum.org/">City Museum</a> was a blast. One person I talked to described WordCamp St. Louis as an incredible value and several other first-time WordCamper&#8217;s shared the same sentiment.</p>\n<p>The organizers did a great job putting this event together. However, if WordCamp St. Louis wants to cater to a larger audience next year, it&#8217;s going to have to find a venue with rooms that hold 30-50 people comfortably.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 06:44:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: An Inside Look at VersionPress’ Crowdfunding Campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=40758";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/an-inside-look-at-versionpress-crowdfunding-campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4416:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[40758]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24643" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="Version Control Featured Image" /></a>Version Control Featured Image\n<p>When <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k">VersionPress missed its crowdfunding goal</a> by raising only 45% of $30K, I cited several contributing factors, including lack of trust, licensing confusion, and the campaign&#8217;s short length. The lead developer of VersionPress, Borek Bernard, shared the <a title="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/03/crowdfunding-campaign-lessons-learned/" href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/03/crowdfunding-campaign-lessons-learned/">lessons he learned</a> from running the campaign on the company&#8217;s blog.</p>\n<p>Bernard explains that despite the campaign being a single page site, a lot of work went into it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our case, the website took over 250 commits and hundreds of hours to get prepared. And it was a seemingly simple, single-page site! This was partly related to the fact that the campaign was self-hosted, but still, some tasks just can’t be skipped. For example, writing copy alone is a huge task should it be any good and easily takes weeks of effort. There are more things like that so be prepared to spend considerable amount of time and effort on the campaign page.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After I <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses">introduced readers to the VersionPress project,</a> several people <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses#comments" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses#comments">voiced their concern</a> over the lack of licensing details. I got in touch with Bernard and explained why so many people were concerned. I explained what the GPL means to the project and the WordPress community in general. I cited examples of successful WordPress product businesses that use the license. I also told him that he&#8217;s likely receive more financial support by being 100% GPL.</p>\n<p>Although it took a few days, <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-adopts-the-gpl-software-license" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-adopts-the-gpl-software-license">Bernard announced</a> VersionPress would be 100% GPL licensed. According to Bernard, the announcement didn&#8217;t translate into more backers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By the way, it was interesting to see what the GPL announcement did to the actual contributions. We were told how the GPL was important and that it would bring us many more supporters, but in actuality, it didn’t have any measurable effect. During the whole campaign, the only factor that strongly correlated with the contributed sum was the number of visitors on the versionpress.net website.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why adopting the GPL license didn&#8217;t have an effect on the number of backers. However, I think that being licensed 100% GPL eliminates potential roadblocks that may have resulted in using a license not compatible with the GPL.</p>\n<p>One of the lessons I learned from VersionsPress&#8217; campaign is that despite not reaching its goal, the amount of feedback from media coverage and backers was enough to verify the idea. The team continues to move forward with development and is <a title="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/02/1-0-rc2-released/" href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/02/1-0-rc2-released/">nearing a 1.0 release</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about launching a crowdfunding campaign, I highly recommend listening to <a title="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-156-a-crowdfunding-roundtable" href="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-156-a-crowdfunding-roundtable">episode 156 of WordPress Weekly</a> where Marcus Couch and I interview Scott Kingsley Clark, John Saddington, and Nick Haskins.

Today co-owners <a href="https://twitter.com/jay_hoffmann" target="_blank">Jay Hoffman</a> and and <a href="https://twitter.com/jackmcconnell" target="_blank">Jack McConnell</a> are branching out to launch a new service that helps customers find a plugin for a $35 fee.</p>\n<p>The Tidy Repo <a href="http://tidyrepo.com/find-plugin-service/" target="_blank">plugin recommendation service</a> is the first of its kind. With more than 36,000 plugins listed in the WordPress.org directory, and thousands more hosted elsewhere, WordPress users can get overwhelmed when trying to pinpoint the right plugin to solve a problem. Without experience or WordPress development knowledge, the process boils down to trial and error.</p>\n<p>Tidy Repo is aiming to eliminate the need for exhaustive research. After testing thousands of plugins, with 250+ published reviews, Hoffman and McConnell believe they can save customers quite a bit of time in selecting the perfect plugin. Both are developers who have written plugins and worked with WordPress for years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a good sense of where conflicts can come up and what is potentially harmful,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;It does become a lot of intuition too. Anyone on the WP Plugin Review team, or the great plugin developers I know, can kind of feel through things and you start being able to spot the weak points very quickly- be that with a conflict in the code, or just a problem with its general user experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoffman has a range of criteria that he measures a plugin&#8217;s code against before recommending it to a customer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most important thing to me is that a plugin makes proper use of the WordPress API. If a plugin sticks to WordPress functions and hooks, that can get us a lot of the way there. It at least goes a long way in ensuring that a plugin won’t bump up against other plugins or themes. </p>\n<p>I’m also looking to make sure that if a plugin is adding something to the front-end, it is doing so in a performant way. Is it minifying CSS / JS files? Taking steps to only include external files on pages where they are necessary? You sometimes hear people complain that WordPress is slow, and I think poor front-end performance in a plugin is often the culprit. </p>\n<p>Code structure also comes into play a bit, but only as it relates to actual function. What I mean is that I don’t necessarily have a preference for structure, as long as it remains consistent. That’s just a sign of a good developer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The basic plugin recommendation package comes with a full report, including the environment it was tested in, and a few secondary recommendations (if warranted). Additional services, such as multiple recommendations, installation, and video walkthroughs can be added to the basic package.</p>\n<p>Hoffman and McConnell hope to grow the database of Tidy Repo reviews alongside the new plugin recommendation service, but neither constitute a full-time endeavor at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s been a labor of love from the beginning, and this is the first time that we’re offering a premium service to our readers,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;Jack and I have a ton of ideas for making the plugin discovery process a lot easier, like more elegant faceted search, in-depth guides, and a ton more, but it’s incredibly difficult to do on top of everything else that life demands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be frank, this is a total experiment for me. There are times when it is incredibly difficult to keep Tidy Repo going, but enough people appear to find it useful that I want to keep it around. Maybe that’s just a long way of saying Tidy Repo would be a dream full-time gig for me, if I ever had the opportunity to do so,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for those who have created a helpful tool or community resource, such as <a href="http://tidyrepo.com/" target="_blank">Tidy Repo</a> or <a href="http://generatewp.com/" target="_blank">GenerateWP</a>, to try to find a way to monetize their efforts. Is there a market for the Tidy Repo co-owners&#8217; experiment? Or will WordPress users continue to stumble on the best plugins through trial and error?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 21:25:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: Remote Work Popularity";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44796";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2015/03/remote-work-popularity/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:145:"<p>Scott Berkun asks <cite><a href="http://scottberkun.com/2015/why-isnt-remote-work-more-popular/">Why Isn’t Remote Work More Popular?</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 21:17:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1797";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://blog.akismet.com/2015/03/17/akismet-3-1-1-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:938:"<p>Version 3.1.1 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>This update includes an improvement to the &#8220;Remove comment author URL&#8221; feature and merges the pingback DDOS protection from Akismet 2.x into the 3.x plugin line.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

It was also designed to be developer friendly with dozens of actions and filters for further customization.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ultimatememberdemo.com/" target="_blank">Live demos</a> are available for the user profiles, member directory, and user account pages.</p>\n<h3>Ultimate Member Extensions Sales Hit $1500 in the First 5 Days</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ultimate-member-extensions.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40639]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ultimate-member-extensions.jpg?resize=1019%2C174" alt="ultimate-member-extensions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40701" /></a></p>\n<p>Co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/calumallison" target="_blank">Calum Allison</a> and Ahmed Elmahd opted to keep the base plugin free and offer additional commercial <a href="https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided to use the free core + paid extensions model as we&#8217;ve seen how successful plugins such as WooCommerce, Ninja Forms, and Easy Digital Downloads have been with this model,&#8221; Allison said. &#8220;We want to try replicate this success in the community/user space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Initial extension sales indicate that the team has identified a competitive niche. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had sales of just under $1,500 from our first five days and we hope this will grow as more extensions are built and more people learn about the plugin,&#8221; Allison told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Ultimate Member is not quite a BuddyPress alternative, but its founding duo entered the market to provide basic social features on top of membership functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin is useful for people looking to build a site where users can sign up and become members but are not necessarily looking to create a full-blown social network which is offered by plugins such as BuddyPress or WP Symposium,&#8221; Allison said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the most popular extensions in terms of sales are the bbPress integration and Social Login extensions. More modular social features, such as private messaging and paid membership upgrades, are currently in the works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Longer term we are considering building themes which are designed specifically for the community niche,&#8221; Allison said.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the duo is focusing on providing support for all users and have answered more than 400 topics on their community forum and the WordPress.org plugin support forum.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made a decision from the beginning that we would provide support for all users of the plugin, regardless of whether they purchased an extension or not,&#8221; Allison said. &#8220;We feel that providing at least some support to free users means they are more likely to want to purchase an extension or two.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ultimate Member is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/ultimatemember/ultimatemember" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for contribution from developers. Co-founders Allison and Elmahd also maintain a <a href="https://trello.com/b/30quaczv/ultimate-member" target="_blank">Trello board</a> for mapping the future of the plugin and managing current issues.</p>\n<p>With a strong set of <a href="https://ultimatemember.com/features/" target="_blank">core features</a> and solid extensions sales numbers right out of the gate, <a href="https://ultimatemember.com/" target="_blank">Ultimate Member</a> is already demonstrating success with the free core plus commercial extensions business model. Even in a seemingly saturated WordPress membership plugin market, a quality product that can zero in on a specific niche has a decent chance of becoming competitive within a short time after launching. The challenge will be keeping up with the level of support they intend to offer for both commercial and free users, while growing the library of extensions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 22:55:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: Pods Framework Security Release Fixes Severe Vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=40651";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://wptavern.com/pods-framework-security-release-fixes-severe-vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3704:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40651]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290" alt="pods" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week <a href="http://wptavern.com/blind-sql-injection-vulnerability-discovered-in-wordpress-seo-plugin-by-yoast-immediate-update-recommended">a blind SQL injection vulnerability</a> was discovered in Yoast&#8217;s popular WordPress SEO plugin. Given the severity of the vulnerability and the fact that the plugin is installed on more than one million WordPress sites, the security team at WordPress.org pushed <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-stay-in-the-loop-if-you-turn-off-wordpress-automatic-updates" target="_blank">a forced update</a> to mitigate the possibility of mass exploitation.</p>\n<p>Following this incident, the <a href="http://pods.io/" target="_blank">Pods framework</a> team proactively performed a security review of their <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/" target="_blank">plugin</a> and found an issue similar to the one discovered and disclosed last week in the WordPress SEO plugin. Contributor Josh Pollock describes the issue in the <a href="http://pods.io/2015/03/16/important-security-disclosure/" target="_blank">release announcement</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe this is an especially severe issue as this issue occurred in the PodsUI class, which is not only used for the Pods admin, but is also employed by many end-users to create front-end and back-end content management interfaces for non-admin users.</p>\n<p>The issue occurred in approximately Line 859 of the PodsUI class. The orderby parameter, which is passed from the browser in a GET variable was subsequently used in an SQL query without being properly sanitized.</p>\n<p>As a result malicious or other unintended SQL queries could be sent to the database by manipulating the GET request.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pods 2.5.1.2, released today, is a security update that patches this vulnerability. If you require an earlier version of the plugin, patched versions of older versions are available the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/developers/" target="_blank">releases page</a>. All users are advised to update immediately.</p>\n<p>The Pods framework is used for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields. It&#8217;s active on more than 30,000 WordPress installations. Contributors on the project credit Yoast&#8217;s transparency on the recent security issue as having inspired their team to proactively examine Pods.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Reading the details of their issue led us to search for similar security issues in Pods,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;We applaud their responsible disclosure to the community. Publishing the details helps other developers work to improve security in their own codebase.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>More Security Updates on the Way for Popular WordPress Plugins</h3>\n<p>All relatively complex plugins will have security issues pop up from time to time that will require immediate patching. Fortunately, the plugin authors in these scenarios have been quick to respond.</p>\n<p>This particular vulnerability is not limited to Pods and the WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast. Pollock advises that WordPress users should be on the lookout for more security updates to follow for other popular plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our team has done a search in several other plugins for similar issues and has reported our findings to their authors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At this time we can not share specifics about theses issues, but will as soon as it is responsible to do so.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 18:17:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Alex King: In Praise of BackupBuddy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=21405";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://alexking.org/blog/2015/03/15/backupbuddy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1571:"<p>I&#8217;m thrilled with my <a href="https://alexking.org/blog/2015/02/25/hosted-on-webfaction">new hosting set-up</a> for this site, however WebFaction doesn&#8217;t offer daily backups.

Brajesh Singh, prolific plugin author and founder of <a href="http://buddydev.com/" target="_blank">BuddyDev</a>, created the plugin to provide Facebook-style real-time notifications for users. Over the past four years, a number of significant changes in both WordPress and BuddyPress have necessitated a complete rewrite of the extension.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://buddydev.com/buddypress/introducing-buddypress-live-notification-2-0/" target="_blank">2.0 version</a> of the plugin adds support for BuddyPress&#8217; new <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-1-9-sammy-released-with-new-notifications-component" target="_blank">notifications component</a>, as well as the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_heartbeat_settings" target="_blank">Heartbeat API</a>, which is now used to fetch the notifications.</p>\n<p>The updated version includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete rewrite of the code to include support for BP notifications component (introduced in BuddyPress 1.9.0)</li>\n<li>Uses WordPress Heartbeat API instead of long AJAX polling for greatly improved performance</li>\n<li>Allows theme authors to change the notifying mechanism by overriding the  notify  method of the  bpln object</li>\n<li>Fires custom JavaScript event bpln:new_notifications when new notifications are received on the client side. A theme author can hook into it to make modifications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because BP Live Notification was designed to be easy to theme and extend, Singh created an <a href="https://github.com/sbrajesh/bp-live-notification-example-module" target="_blank">example plugin</a> to demonstrate how to replace the notify window UI with your own customization.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jquery-notice-style.png" rel="prettyphoto[40500]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jquery-notice-style.png?resize=449%2C250" alt="jquery-notice-style" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40617" /></a></p>\n<p>The sample plugin repackages the notification window with the <a href="https://github.com/sbrajesh/bp-live-notification-example-module/tree/master/assets/notify" target="_blank">jQuery notice plugin</a>. Check out a <a href="http://creativedream.net/plugins/jquery.notify/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see how that style of notice is presented.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like how BP Live Notification styles its alerts by default, you can easily integrate a different jQuery notice plugin using the example Singh posted on GitHub.

Many users were taken by surprise, given that the WordPress codex clearly stated that automatic plugin and theme updates are disabled by default.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the automatic update rolled out, the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates" target="_blank">codex page</a> was updated to reflect the fact that in rare instances WordPress.org will automatically update your plugins and themes unless you opt to turn this feature off entirely. Many users are not comfortable with forced automatic updates, but the good news is that there is a filter to turn them off, including the WordPress.org security updates for popular plugins:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_filter( ''auto_update_plugin'', ''__return_false'' );</pre>\n<p>Prior to this security issue, users were not aware that they had to opt out of these forced updates. On one side of the fence there are those who think it&#8217;s no big deal and are thankful that WordPress.org is proactive on behalf of user security.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are those who are wary of forced updates from plugin authors who are notorious for pushing out problematic updates. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo">support forum</a> for Yoast&#8217;s SEO plugin contains many threads regarding fatal errors following updates issued in the past.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, Nick Haskins <a href="http://nickhaskins.com/2015/03/on-automatic-wordpress-updates/" target="_blank">summarizes</a> why he was not comfortable with WordPress.org&#8217;s forced update:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The plugin in question is Yoast WordPress SEO. If you’re not familiar with his plugins, the history of updates is awful. In the last two weeks, I’ve updated twice, and both times have resulted in fatal PHP errors which require FTP’ing into the site, to manually remove the plugin. Both cases were due to not checking if a file exists before loading it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those who are not comfortable with WordPress.org&#8217;s forced update policy have the option to turn updates off for particular plugins or for all plugins. If you opt to go the route of turning automatic updates off, there are alternative ways that you can stay up-to-date on plugin releases.</p>\n<h3>Get Email Notices When Core, Plugin, and Theme Updates are Available</h3>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/air-mail.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40498]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/air-mail.jpg?resize=1018%2C494" alt="photo credit: Par avion - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-40600" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79016591@N07/13204207393">Par avion</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>No site admin can realistically be expected to log into his site(s) and check for update every day, let alone follow all the news surrounding plugin and theme security issues. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updates-notifier/" target="_blank">WP Updates Notifier</a> plugin will monitor your WordPress installation for updates and will send you an email as they become available. It includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the interval of how often to check for updates; hourly, twice daily or daily.</li>\n<li>Sets WordPress to check for updates more often meaning you get to know about updates sooner.</li>\n<li>Get emailed about core, plugin and theme updates.</li>\n<li>Chose if you want to be notified about active only themes and plugins updates.</li>\n<li>Remove upgrade nag message to non-admin users.</li>\n<li>For advanced users there are a number of filters and actions you can use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be truly awesome if WP Updates Notifier was also able to scan a plugin&#8217;s changelog for the word &#8220;Security&#8221; and tack it onto the email if it is applicable.</p>\n<p>WP Updates Notifier can be useful even if you&#8217;re comfortable allowing WordPress.org to perform occasional forced updates to themes and plugins for security. You may be using a plugin that is not nearly popular enough meet the criteria for a forced automatic update. Regardless, it may be useful for you to know as soon as there is an update available.</p>\n<p>The important thing is to stay in the loop about potential security issues and get patches as soon as they are available. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updates-notifier/" target="_blank">WP Updates Notifier</a> lets you do that without having to allow any third party update core, plugins, or themes on your server. The plugin is most useful when you have only a handful of sites or fewer. Otherwise, it&#8217;s probably better to utilize a central dashboard service where you check in regularly to see updates across all of your sites at once.</p>\n<p>Your other alternative is to ditch plugins created by authors who you cannot trust to issue clean updates. That will put you in a better position to leave automatic background updates on, which is recommended for the vast majority of WordPress users.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 19:38:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"Post Status: Running a successful membership site in real life, with Jonathan Williamson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://poststatus.com/?p=7208";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"https://poststatus.com/running-a-wordpress-membership-website-jonathan-williamson/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12427:"<p>Jonathan Williamson is the co-founder and COO of <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>, a membership website that provides as an educational resource for computer graphics and modeling. CGCookie has been around since 2008, and today is a network of five websites, has thousands of paying members, a team of six full time employees plus a number of contractors.</p>\n<p>CGCookie is built completely on WordPress and has a built in membership component. Some astute readers may recognize both the site and Jonathan&#8217;s name; Jonathan is <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">Pippin Williamson&#8217;s</a> identical twin brother, and Pippin has worked with Jonathan on CGCookie many times. So, in this interview, you&#8217;re not listening to me talk to Pippin &#8212; though it sounds like it &#8212; but I&#8217;m talking to Jonathan Williamson.</p>\n<p>Jonathan is as passionate about CG, modeling, 3D printing, and the software that surrounds these disciplines as Pippin is about WordPress and programming. It was a pleasure to talk to Jonathan about what it&#8217;s like to run a membership site that runs on WordPress. I think this interview will be beneficial for those that want to run a membership site, and also those that work with clients who make their living off of their website.</p>\n<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(''audio'');</script><![endif]-->\n<a href="http://audio.simplecast.fm/9023.mp3">http://audio.simplecast.fm/9023.mp3</a><br />\n<a href="http://audio.simplecast.fm/9023.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">Or subscribe to the Post Status Draft podcast on iTunes!</a></p>\n<h3>How CGCookie evolved</h3>\n<p>CGCookie started as a blog with news, tutorials, and resources for CG enthusiasts. The first form of its monetization was by selling the source files for the various tutorials. Within about two years, Jonathan and co-founder Wes Burke decided to add a membership component that ended up working far better than they anticipated.</p>\n<p>Jonathan has been working full-time on CGCookie since around the summer of 2009. They originally launched on aMember, before eventually migrating to Pippin&#8217;s <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> plugin, along with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, CGCookie has more than 120,000 free users, and they have around 4,800 paid members.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, CGCookie have managed to not have a full time web developer until February of 2014, when they hired Nick Haskins. You may recognize Nick as the founder of <a title="Aesop, a Medium-esque “story engine” for WordPress" href="https://poststatus.com/aesop-medium-esque-story-engine-wordpress/">Aesop Stories</a> as well. Nick manages front-end development for the site, and they still don&#8217;t have a backend developer &#8212; though a backend developer and designer are on their roadmap.</p>\n<h3>How CGCookie&#8217;s eCommerce setup runs</h3>\n<p>Considering Jonathan is using his brother&#8217;s own plugins in the real world, it makes for a great avenue for feedback and insight for Pippin to improve those products.</p>\n<p>CGCookie is using Restrict Content Pro for <a href="https://cgcookie.com/membership/">memberships</a> themselves, and EDD plus the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/frontend-submissions/">Front-End Submissions</a> add-on for their <a href="http://cgcookiemarkets.com/blender/">marketplace</a>. We talked about whether EDD could be used for both, or if there is room for improvement in the marriage between the two systems, and he believes there is and that it&#8217;s a goal for the two plugins. For instance, currently, reporting and user management and a number of other features are independent between each plugin even though often times the users that utilize the system may overlap.</p>\n<p>I asked Jonathan about scaling WordPress and eCommerce for their large user base. He says that scaling for eCommerce has not been difficult, but with over a hundred thousand users, some default WordPress functionality has not scaled well; for instance, some admin areas create dropdowns for all users, which does not work well. Fortunately, there are some trac tickets in place currently to help solve some of these problems.</p>\n<h3>Prioritizing goals for a membership site</h3>\n<p>When discussing challenges running a membership site, Jonathan highlights the internal battles: balancing new features versus iterative improvements. Based on my short experience managing this membership site, I completely agree.</p>\n<p>For an example, Jonathan told me about a potential question and answer system to help his members get answers for specific technical topics that may be beyond the scope of a specific course. They believe a Stack Exchange style setup that allows them to refer their courses to specific questions would allow them to better serve their customers with the same content they already have.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you get people to find your content that answers their question, but you don&#8217;t have a way of just explicitly saying that these are the questions this course answers?</p></blockquote>\n<p>They&#8217;re considering a method of post to post relationships that direct courses as question answers and vice versa. For this feature and others, they try to do things with a short return on investment, but they also don&#8217;t want to be a slave to it. They sometimes do things &#8220;that are important to the quality of CGCookie, that never make a dime.&#8221; They removed ads last year under that very premise, to make CGCookie a better learning experience.</p>\n<h3>Not the only place to learn</h3>\n<p>Jonathan knows CGCookie isn&#8217;t the only place to learn, so they focus on creating an excellent community and learning experience for their customers.</p>\n<p>Realizing that our sites aren&#8217;t the only way to get certain information is an important thing to know to be able to better focus what we create for our users and why we create it.</p>\n<h3>Pricing for CGCookie</h3>\n<p>CGCookie has pricing for monthly, quarterly, or yearly pricing; all plans renew automatically unless explicitly cancelled. This is a feature they actively A/B test to see what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>Behavior of customers varies between the three levels. Jonathan says that the users are more invested in their purchases (and getting more out of it) when they sign up for longer. Quarterly members have 10% longer lifetime memberships and spend three times longer on the site.</p>\n<p>However, they do have &#8220;a fair bit&#8221; of what I called &#8220;download and dash&#8221; members that sign up for a month, download a bunch of assets and cancel. Monthly memberships are also the most popular plan. They&#8217;ve considered locking down downloads for monthly signups but it&#8217;s not something they want to do unless it becomes a bigger problem; however they do lose money on those customers that download gigabytes of files and videos but only stay subscribed for one month.</p>\n<h3>Testing</h3>\n<p>During A/B tests, they have found that people will be just as likely to sign up for quarterly as monthly if monthly isn&#8217;t available, and quarterly members are more engaged. One thing they noted is that once people stick around for a few months, the average tenure of a user skyrockets; they have some users that have been a paying member as long as the site has been running.</p>\n<p>One of my big takeaways talking to Jonathan was about how significant testing can be. Their tests help them decide on the optimal pricing and payment plans to maximize a lifetime value.</p>\n<p>For testing, insights, and statistics they use <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, and Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Mixpanel allows you to create custom events in your software, and does require some code knowledge, but it can deliver valuable insights if you use it correctly. Jonathan notes, &#8220;It&#8217;s basically as comprehensive as you make it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They can also mesh tools. They can track which A/B test from Optimizely a customer signed up with, and then use Mixpanel to track what they did and how they did it. They can get login metrics, renewal numbers, and more for each plan and signup flow.</p>\n<p>Mixpanel requires PHP and JavaScript knowledge to utilize, but Optimizely has an extensive visual interface that doesn&#8217;t require code knowledge to utilize.</p>\n<h3>What encourages membership signups</h3>\n<p>&#8220;It varies day to day, week to week, month to month,&#8221; in regard to how their signups work. A bad month in the economy can make their signups go down. Sometimes quarterly users will spike while monthly users are steady.</p>\n<p>Their biggest thing that affects signup rates is customer support. Some presale, but also support for new members to help answer questions and get people engaged. <span class="pullquote alignright">When we can help someone answer the question, &#8220;Where do I go next?&#8221;, we are able to keep them for a long time.</span></p>\n<p>They have one or two courses that drive a ton of traffic to their site, and it is therefore their largest onboarding channel for new members. However, they don&#8217;t have a silver bullet for what it takes to get new users. They are always trying new things.</p>\n<h3>On competing and the industry</h3>\n<p>Jonathan doesn&#8217;t see themselves as a part of a singular industry. While many think of CG as a part of the film industry, it&#8217;s one of dozens of potential applications, and they don&#8217;t want to narrow themselves to a particular one.</p>\n<p>They also poll users to get a feel for who they are and what industry actual users come from. Based on around a thousand responses, they had no real pattern at all. The results were all over the board.</p>\n<p>So they don&#8217;t want to compete with a film tutorials site or any other industry site. They want to focus on the tool itself. They want to teach people how to use Blender and show them how it can be applied to various industries their users are a part of.</p>\n<h3>Advice for those running membership sites</h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Build your community would be the main one. It&#8217;s one thing to offer a really good product. It&#8217;s one thing to build a really good website. But if you don&#8217;t have the community behind you that&#8217;s going to be willing to trust in you with their wallet &#8230; it&#8217;s not going to go anywhere long term, sustainably.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jonathan says it&#8217;s about building the community as well as the sense of trust within that community. He believes that customers will want to know that not only the content will be worth it, but that it will continue to be worth it &#8212; and that the communication and support from the team behind the site will be consistent as well.</p>\n<p>He believes that subscriptions and products are very different. With a subscription, the interaction is just as or far more important than specific content itself.</p>\n<p>When he refers to community, he doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be strictly through something like a forum. He considers it a broad term, and for them it evolved out of their Blender community user base. At the time we recorded this, they didn&#8217;t have forums, a dedicated chat system, or an actual community integration part &#8212; though <a href="http://community.cgcookie.com/">they have opened a forum</a> since we chatted. But the community exists and thrives within comments and their gallery functionality.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping up</h3>\n<p>Jonathan is full of great advice and I could listen to him talk about membership sites for a long time. I have no experience with CG but at the end of this interview he had me wanted to go build something with Blender.</p>\n<p>You can (and should) keep up with <a href="https://twitter.com/carter2422">Jonathan on Twitter</a>, or perhaps you&#8217;ll see him at a conference near you &#8212; but you&#8217;ll probably think it&#8217;s Pippin at first.

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>About two months ago, I released my first commercial WordPress product, <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, a plugin that makes deploying themes and plugins really easy. WP Pusher was not meant to be &#8220;just a plugin&#8221;. It was supposed to be a SaaS product, and throughout it all, when I was building it, I always thought of it as a startup I was creating.</p>\n<p>For &#8220;just a WordPress plugin&#8221;, I think it has been quite successful so far, and to a large extent, I believe that to be a result of my own perception of the whole thing. I think it was more successful because, even after I realized it was just going to be a plugin, I still treated it as a startup.</p>\n<h2>What Is a Startup?</h2>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/office.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[40528]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/office.jpeg?resize=1025%2C493" alt="office" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40552" /></a></p>\n<p>In the fall of 2014, I was traveling around Southeast Asia, enjoying the digital nomad lifestyle, while making WP Pusher. I spent quite a bit of time in Chiang Mai, the capital of digital nomads, and everyone was talking about a guy named Pieter Levels, who did all kinds of cool things, all related to digital nomadism. One of these things was to take up the challenge of building a new startup every month for 12 months.</p>\n<p>Hearing people talk about Pieter&#8217;s startup quest got me thinking about the term &#8220;startup&#8221;. Honestly, when I first heard about it, I did not think of the 12 startups as real startups &#8211; which Pieter obviously did. To me, creating a portfolio of 12 startups in such a short time seemed a bit silly. In my head, a real startup required more dedication and commitment than that.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, some of Pieter&#8217;s startups have been really successful and the whole process has been really inspiring to follow. I now understand that my idea of a startup was missing some pieces. All of the 12 projects that Pieter created qualified as startups. Some of them were more successful than others, but he validated 12 ideas in a short time and the result is really impressive. And one thing, which is very important, is that Pieter treated all of the 12 projects as startups instead of just another side project (which is how many developers talk about their projects). Calling something a side project is an easy way of protecting yourself against your fear of failure.</p>\n<p>If you ask Steve Blank about his definition of a startup, he will tell you that <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/" target="_blank">&#8220;a startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model&#8221;</a>. If we break that up, “an organization” can mean anything. It can be you alone or it can be a team. “Repeatable” and “scalable” are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>Building a WordPress plugin and calling it a day is not enough. That is not a startup. Honestly, to me, “repeatable“ is the main factor. I am in it for the freedom &#8211; not the empire building. I want a business to be repeatable in the sense that I can teach someone else how to run it for me &#8211; hence, freedom. It does not have to be scalable in order to put food on my table or allow me to travel around the world &#8211; it just has to be profitable.</p>\n<p>WordPress offers a giant market full of small niches and potential customers. There is no reason why something you are building for WordPress could not be as huge as any other software startup. The market share of the WordPress platform is <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/" target="_blank">large enough</a>.</p>\n<p>In relation to the Steve Blank quote, what could you do to make your WordPress plugin a startup instead of a side project? First of all, you need to think about the &#8220;organization&#8221;. Most likely, you are the programmer or the engineer behind your product. But do you know how to design a shiny, high-converting landing page? Do you have any clue about how to approach marketing or customer relations? What about the legal and financial aspects? Maybe you do. If you do not, you need to either be willing to learn or team up with someone who does. At the very minimum, you need to at least consider it.</p>\n<p>How can you build a business around a WordPress plugin that is more &#8220;repeatable&#8221; and &#8220;scalable&#8221;? Well, you could do most of the things that other startups do. Here are a few questions to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could you charge more or offer more expensive options?</li>\n<li>Could you turn your plugin into a SaaS or find something that you could charge for on a recurring basis?</li>\n<li>Could you sell additional add-ons or extensions for your plugin?</li>\n<li>Could you offer a service in addition to your plugin?</li>\n<li>Given you solve some kind of pain for your customers, could you copy your idea to other niches or customer segments?</li>\n<li>Could you come up with ways to attract more customers on a recurring basis? (SEO, content marketing, advertising etc.)</li>\n<li>Could you have someone else help you find new customers? (copywriters, affiliate partners etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You get it.</p>\n<h2>Solving Your Own Problems vs. Solving Other People&#8217;s Problems</h2>\n<p>A very important point I want to make relates to the business idea of your WordPress plugin. In a market like WordPress, programmers tend to be tempted to find solutions to their own problems &#8211; not necessarily other people&#8217;s problems. Finding a solution for a problem you have yourself is a good place to start and great for motivation, domain knowledge and so on, but it is not enough.</p>\n<p>If you want it to be a business, you need to make sure that other people have the same problem and are willing to pay for it. Startups are not made to solve their own problems. The original business idea behind the startup might have been to solve a problem the founder had, but if the only customer in the startup is going to be the founder alone, it is not a very good business model. You need to figure out how you can make your product relevant to more people &#8211; not everyone of course, but more people than yourself.</p>\n<p>As an example, WP Pusher solves a problem I had with clients. There were already solutions to this problem &#8211; both free and paid. Most of them required either Git installed or that I granted them access to my clients&#8217; servers. Given I am actually in control of, or at least have an influence over, most of the server environments of my clients, I could in theory have used one of these existing solutions.</p>\n<p>However, I knew that was not the case for a lot of WordPress developers. I saw the possibility of solving my own problem as well as solving a problem I knew a lot of other developers had. Reading about Pieter&#8217;s 12 startups inspires me to build more products for WordPress. Solve more problems. Build more startups.</p>\n<h2>Say It Out Loud</h2>\n<p>When I thought WP Pusher was going to be a SaaS business, I thought of it as a startup. When I decided to change the business model and rebuild it all as a single plugin, it felt weird calling it a business &#8211; or even a startup. For a short time I think I phrased it as &#8220;just a project for WordPress&#8221;, when telling people about it.</p>\n<p>Personally, I still like to think of it as a startup. I kept the landing page I built for the SaaS and I kept the blog I set up. I kept everything that I initially made when it was a &#8220;startup&#8221; I was working on. Today, I have made a conscious decision that it is in fact a startup &#8211; no matter how big or small it is.</p>\n<p>WP Pusher has many characteristics of a startup. It solves a very obvious pain point that is easy to communicate. It has a simple business model in a very large market. And finally, it has a logo and it has a nice landing page. That is a startup right there.</p>\n<p>What are you missing before you can confidently call your WordPress plugin a startup?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 21:28:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Matt: Portland + Phoenix Press Publish Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44801";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://ma.tt/2015/03/portland-phoenix-press-publish-events/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:775:"<p>We&#8217;re organizing an exciting <a href="http://presspublish.events/">new conference series focused on blogging, called Press Publish</a>.

In addition to the bug fix, calls made to the Akismet API are now encrypted via SSL.</p>\n<p>While it may not seem like much on the surface, encrypting communications between WordPress and Akismet is an important change that increases the privacy of those who leave comments on your site. Christopher Finke, who works on the Akismet development team, explains why:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akismet&#8217;s API is being offered over SSL for the same reason that all <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> subdomains are <a title="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/reset-the-net/" href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/reset-the-net/">now served over SSL by default</a>. Encrypting that connection decreases the chances of surveillance by a third-party. No matter what a commenter is writing about, sending their comment to be checked using SSL ensures that it will only be read by those who are meant to read it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The move is part of a larger effort to apply SSL across WordPress.com and WordPress.org. In late 2014, almost all of WordPress.org <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/09/23/wordpress-org-is-now-forced-ssl/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/09/23/wordpress-org-is-now-forced-ssl/">was transitioned</a> to load over SSL/HTTPS. As part of the security hardening process of WordPress 3.7, <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API">api.wordpress.org,</a> which handles theme, plugin, and core updates, was forced to use SSL if the webserver supports it.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what SSL is or would like to learn how to implement it on your site, read the <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/">HTTPS section in the WordPress user manual</a>.

If you&#8217;re using Jetpack on all your sites, you can quickly update them by visiting: <a href="https://wordpress.com/plugins/wordpress-seo" target="_blank">https://wordpress.com/plugins/wordpress-seo</a>. There you will see all the sites where you have the plugin installed and can update from your centralized dashboard.</p>\n<p>Hosting companies are scrambling to add a fix to protect customers. The Pressable status blog sent out an <a href="http://status.pressable.com/2015/03/11/wordpress-seo-vulnerability/" target="_blank">advisory</a> on the vulnerability and is immediately updating installations where the plugin is active:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our systems have already begun updating this plugin across all impacted sites on our systems, and we expect this process to be completed shortly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SiteGround has added a <a href="https://www.siteground.com/blog/wordpress-seo-by-yoast-vulnerability/" target="_blank">temporary fix</a> to tide customers over in the meantime before they have the chance to update. The company added new security rules to its WAF (web application firewall), which will actively filter any possible incoming hacking attempts that try to exploit the vulnerability.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Our security team has just added a fix to protect customers from a vulnerability in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WP?src=hash">#WP</a> SEO plugin by Yoast <a href="https://t.co/nP9qrJaO0x">https://t.co/nP9qrJaO0x</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; SiteGround (@SiteGround) <a href="https://twitter.com/SiteGround/status/575701133550878720">March 11, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> is active on more than one million websites.

The plugin adds @mentions to the visual editor with autocomplete for any content published on the site, including posts, pages, media, and custom post types.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mentionable.png" rel="prettyphoto[39424]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mentionable.png?resize=843%2C438" alt="mentionable" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40405" /></a></p>\n<p>Mentionable includes a settings panel for specifying the post types for which the plugin will be active. You can also select the post types that the auto-completion will match against. Users can further customize the plugin by replacing the mentionable tag with a custom <em>mentionable.php</em> template.</p>\n<p>The support for custom post types means that users can call out recipes, books, movies, products, or posts from any registered content type as links within pages or posts. This makes it easy to link to the backstory for new content, put together quick reference lists, cross promote products, etc. &#8211; all without ever having to leave the post editor.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised. When mentioning a post you don&#8217;t even have to start with the first word of the post title. The autocomplete will pick up any word found in a title, in case your memory of the exact title is foggy.</p>\n<p>If you decide later on that you don&#8217;t want to use the plugin anymore, it won&#8217;t affect any of the links you created previously. Your content remains intact even after the plugin is deactivated and uninstalled.</p>\n<p>A healthy amount of internal linking is often recommended for boosting your site&#8217;s SEO. According to Moz, <a href="http://moz.com/learn/seo/internal-link" target="_blank">internal links</a> are critical for establishing site architecture and spreading link juice.

The survey took place between February 18th-20th and was answered by 503 WordPress users. Backing up is an important part of maintaining a website, so it&#8217;s a bit shocking to see such high percentages of people who either don&#8217;t backup on a regular basis or who don&#8217;t think backup plans are important.</p>\n<p>Out of 503 respondents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% have received &#8220;very little training&#8221; in the use of WordPress</li>\n<li>22% haven&#8217;t been trained at all in WordPress backup and have &#8220;no idea&#8221; how to do it</li>\n<li>21% have seen the &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; multiple times, and &#8220;it&#8217;s horrible!&#8221;</li>\n<li>69% have had a plugin fail after an update, and 24% have had it happen &#8220;many times&#8221;</li>\n<li>63% have deleted files that were not backed up</li>\n<li>22% said that a backup plugin seems &#8220;unimportant&#8221; to them</li>\n<li>24% said &#8220;This site is my livelihood, I&#8217;d pay almost anything for a complete restore,&#8221; while 19% said they&#8217;d be willing to spend several thousand dollars, at least</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m surprised to see only 24% of respondents use a backup plugin at all considering there&#8217;s so many <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=backup" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=backup">free options available</a>. There appears to be a correlation between those who have little to no WordPress training and the lack of education on how to establish a backup plan. I realize 503 WordPress users is not a large sample size, but the numbers indicate more education is needed on backup software, services, and strategies.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also alarming to see 69% of respondents have had a plugin fail after an update and 24% of those have had it happen several times. This is further proof that WordPress is <a title="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-wordpress-to-automatically-update-themes-plugins-and-core-by-default" href="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-wordpress-to-automatically-update-themes-plugins-and-core-by-default">not ready to automatically update plugins</a> by default.</p>\n<p>An important data point missing from the survey is how many of the respondents rely on automatic backups provided by their webhost. Not every user needs a plugin to manage backups and for a number of managed WordPress hosting companies, automatic backups are part of the package. In fact, most managed WordPress hosting providers discourage and disallow backup plugins from being used. An <a title="http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/" href="http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/">example is WP Engine</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In general, however, we discourage the use of backup plugins. They needlessly duplicate our built-in functionality, rely on a large amount of local storage and can store files in an insecure manner. Not only that, many of these plugins run their backup jobs at inopportune times.

The idea for the function was suggested by Caspar Hübinger, a long-time user of the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a spam comment with a Gravatar image?  I haven’t,&#8221; Hübinger said in a <a href="http://glueckpress.com/6500/trust-the-gravatar/" target="_blank">post</a> introducing the new feature. &#8220;So I suggested to include an option in Antispam Bee to trust commenters with a Gravatar by default, and Sergej, creator of Antispam Bee, was kind enough to implement it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the plugin was mentioned by Matt Mullenweg during his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe 2014, English speakers have largely overlooked it in the past. Antispam Bee was created by German WordPress plugin developer <a href="http://wpcoder.de/" target="_blank">Sergej Müller</a> and its description page on WordPress.org is written in German. He has actively developed and maintained the plugin since 2009. It is currently used on 200,000+ installations of WordPress.</p>\n<p>One might think that it would make sense to include an English copy of the description to gain a larger user base, but Müller elected to keep it in German due to the plugin&#8217;s incompatibilities. Antispam Bee is incompatible with many of the major commenting systems used by English speakers, including Disqus, Jetpack Comments, and AJAX Comment Form.</p>\n<p>English speakers who use <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/comments/" target="_blank">Jetpack Comments</a> often use <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a>, since the two work together seamlessly. Akismet is far more well-known, since it comes packaged with WordPress by default. However, Antispam Bee has a solid set of features that make it a decent alternative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ad-free</li>\n<li>No storage of personal data</li>\n<li>No registration required</li>\n<li>Free for commercial projects</li>\n<li>No adjustment required by theme templates</li>\n<li>All functions can be controlled by the user</li>\n<li>Statistics for the last 30 days displayed as a dashboard widget</li>\n<li>Supports six languages: German, English, French, Russian, Dutch, and Slovenian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin also comes with 20 configurable options for customizing its spam-blocking features, including the ability to disable spam email notifications, block comments from certain countries, allow comments only in certain languages, delete after X days, and much more. These options allow you to tailor your anti-spam shield to lessen your moderation load.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/antispam-bee.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40344]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/antispam-bee.jpg?resize=1025%2C714" alt="antispam-bee" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40377" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re intrigued by <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" target="_blank">Antispam Bee</a>&#8216;s latest feature that allows you to trust commenters who have a Gravatar, give the plugin a try the next time you&#8217;re reviewing spam-blocking solutions. The option is a creative use of WordPress&#8217; built-in support for Gravatar. Current users of the plugin can find the new setting in the admin under <strong>Settings > Antispam Bee</strong>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 19:06:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: WPupdatePHP Project Aims to Help WordPress Users Get on Newer Versions of PHP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=40303";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/wpupdatephp-project-aims-to-help-wordpress-users-get-on-newer-versions-of-php";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4470:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/php.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40303]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/php.jpg?resize=700%2C329" alt="photo credit: Feediza.com" class="size-full wp-image-40331" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://feediza.com/">Feediza.com</a>\n<p>Developers are anxious for WordPress to bump up the minimum PHP requirement for core, as it&#8217;s currently lingering at 5.2, which is no longer among the <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php" target="_blank">supported versions of PHP</a>. As of August 2014, PHP 5.3 no longer receives patches for security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-version-stats-updated-more-than-13-of-sites-are-running-wordpress-4-1" target="_blank">Recent updates to WordPress.org stats</a> indicate that 16.4% of WordPress sites are still running on PHP 5.2 and 38% on PHP 5.3. According to lead developer Andrew Nacin, bumping the minimum required version is not likely to happen soon, due to the sheer number of sites that would be negatively impacted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One-sixth of all sites running PHP 5.2 is still many millions of sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we move the PHP minimum version too early, we risk stranding millions of installs on older versions of WordPress.&#8221; In the meantime, the WordPress project is researching the current state of PHP offerings available at popular hosts and will soon be urging them to update to more recent versions.</p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href="http://coenjacobs.me/" target="_blank">Coen Jacobs</a> believes that the effort to contact hosts will not be enough to help everyone. His new <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/" target="_blank">WPupdatePHP</a> project was created to educate end users on outdated versions of PHP. The <a href="https://github.com/WPupdatePHP/wp-update-php" target="_blank">WPupdatePHP library</a> is a tool that developers can bundle into their plugins in order to require users to upgrade to PHP 5.4+ hosting. It is intended for use within new plugins, not for locking users out of existing ones.</p>\n<p>If a user does not meet the minimum PHP version requirements when installing the plugin, he will be presented with an admin notice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this plugin can not run on PHP versions older than [ specified version ]. Read more information about <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/">how you can update</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea of the WPupdatePHP project is to enlist end users in putting pressure on hosts to <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/" target="_blank">update their versions of PHP</a>. A future version of the library would add the ability for developers to make the PHP version a “soft requirement,” which would still display the notice but won’t stop the user from using the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core WordPress team can’t get every single hosting company to comply,&#8221; Jacobs said in a recent post titled <em><a href="http://coenjacobs.me/updating-php-everyones-responsibility/" target="_blank">Updating PHP is Everyone’s Responsibility</a></em>. &#8220;I admire their intentions, but in reality this is not going to help everybody.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He predicts a need for the WPupdatePHP library even after WordPress bumps its minimum required PHP version. &#8220;PHP 5.4 is actually already nearing its EOL date and we’re still figuring out how to make PHP 5.2 and 5.3 platforms go away,&#8221; he said. In mid-September 2015, PHP 5.4 will not longer receive security fixes.</p>\n<p>Jacobs believes that the changes that need to happen require more than a one-time campaign where the WordPress project successfully badgers hosts to update to PHP 5.4.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In six months we’ll have this same issue all over again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as webhosting companies have finally finished off their PHP 5.2 and 5.3 environments, we can start this whole campaign all over again to get rid of PHP 5.4. And so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you are a WordPress developer interested in enlisting your plugin&#8217;s users to help push hosts to update PHP versions, check out <a href="https://github.com/WPupdatePHP/wp-update-php" target="_blank">WPupdatePHP on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The end user is one of our most important, but underestimated, assets in this battle,&#8221; Jacobs said. &#8220;They have the strongest voice in this all.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Mar 2015 22:24:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: WordPress.com Adds oEmbed Support For CartoDB Maps";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=40265";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-oembed-support-for-cartodb-maps";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1371:"<p>WordPress.com <a title="https://en.support.wordpress.com/cartodb-embeds/" href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/cartodb-embeds/">now supports oEmbeds</a> for<a title="http://cartodb.com/" href="http://cartodb.com/"> CartoDB,</a> a tool used to create and share interactive maps.

Lovecraft</a>, an American horror fiction author known for his &#8220;weird realism&#8221; &#8211; the idea that reality is fundamentally weird and the human mind is incapable of realistically representing it.</p>\n<p>Norén&#8217;s tribute to Lovecraft&#8217;s work is conveyed most clearly through the serif-heavy typography of the theme and a strong focus on the imagery assigned to each post. He selected Google Font&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display" target="_blank">Playfair Display</a> for page and post headers, accompanied by Georgia for the body text. The bright red links and red post meta complement the design&#8217;s literary theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png" rel="prettyphoto[40251]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="lovecraft" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40267" /></a></p>\n<p>The homepage showcases a full-width header image and each post replaces that image with its own featured image. These images, along with the rest of the theme, gracefully scale down for smaller devices.</p>\n<p>Lovecraft, like many other recently released themes, adds additional features by offering support for <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a>, including the infinite scroll module and styles for tiled galleries.</p>\n<p>Norén took every small detail into consideration when creating Lovecraft, as you can see with the blockquotes design, ordered lists, post media, and form styles on the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/style-guide/" target="_blank">Style Guide</a> page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40251]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg?resize=617%2C217" alt="lovecraft-blockquote" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40283" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme allows you to select the accent color via the customizer. It also includes support for a custom logo, editor styles, and matching widgets for Flicker, recent posts, and recent comments with thumbnails. Pages have an additional template for full-width display. Check out the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see Lovecraft in action.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a bold new theme for your blog and you appreciate strong serif fonts, Lovecraft is a thoughtfully-designed option.

According to court documents, United States Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero <a title="http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf" href="http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf">wrote a report</a> and recommendation in favor of Automattic and Hotham. The <a title="http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf" href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf">courts agreed with his report</a> and recommendation.

(42, 1, '2015-03-03 19:11:07', '2015-03-03 19:11:07', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like.

(77, 1, '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '', 42, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/77', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(78, 2, '2015-03-11 12:57:15', '2015-03-11 12:57:15', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(81, 1, '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\n\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\n\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\n\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\n\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/81', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic.

The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-11 22:25:29', '2015-03-11 22:25:29', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/89', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole?

In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 07:48:32', '2015-03-12 07:48:32', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/92', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(93, 2, '2015-03-12 07:49:08', '2015-03-12 07:49:08', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air.

(96, 2, '2015-03-12 08:23:12', '2015-03-12 08:23:12', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 08:23:12', '2015-03-12 08:23:12', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/96', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 14:29:09', '2015-03-12 14:29:09', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/99', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(100, 1, '2015-03-12 14:29:41', '2015-03-12 14:29:41', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff.

Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 14:43:01', '2015-03-12 14:43:01', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/103', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month.

In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time.

In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-15 11:40:12', '2015-03-15 11:40:12', '', 42, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/153', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(170, 2, '2015-03-15 21:47:12', '2015-03-15 21:47:12', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(173, 2, '2015-02-05 22:27:53', '2015-02-05 22:27:53', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.\r\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece.', 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'dr-strangelove', '', '', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/?p=173', 0, 'post', '', 0),

He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace.

Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence".

(182, 2, '2015-03-15 22:42:53', '2015-03-15 22:42:53', '"Nightcrawler" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don''t detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou''s routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he''s there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Nightcrawler2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that "Nightcrawler" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it''s the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but "Nightcrawler" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\r\n\r\n"Nightcrawler," in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year''s "Prisoners," plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahowny," showing his character''s complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn''t be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal''s Lou in a role that could''ve been an empty, and even distracting, side role.

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death.

It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride ''Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai'' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-165" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2-1024x427.jpg" alt="Kill-Bill2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis film''s a sampling of the Tarantino ''fury,'' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

(187, 1, '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.\r\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece.', 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '173-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '', 173, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/187', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(206, 2, '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '"The Hunt" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I''ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp''s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she''s in.\r\n\r\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.

(209, 2, '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '"The Hunt" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I''ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp''s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she''s in.\r\n\r\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children''s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing.
