We’ve brought these experiences from your admin and re-created them right here on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Theme Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Directory</a> has a better browsing experience, with handy tabs where you can view featured, popular, and the latest themes. As with the theme experience in your admin, you can use the feature filter to browse for just the right theme for your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3572" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Click on a theme to get more information about it, including shiny screenshots, ratings, and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3573" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-individual-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory-individual" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/10/new-theme-directory/">posted a good overview</a> of everything involved with the theme directory overhaul and followed up with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/">a post on improved statistics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">Plugin Directory</a> has a brand new theme that mirrors the experience in your WordPress admin, with a more visual experience, and better search and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3594" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/plugin-directory-1024x768.png" alt="plugin-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>As well as a facelift, there are some great new features for you to play around with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorites – when you’re logged in to you WordPress.org account, this page gives you direct access to the plugins that you have favorited.</li>\n<li>Beta Testing – try out plugins where developers are experimenting with new features for WordPress.</li>\n<li>Search by plugin author – you can search for a plugin author using their username.</li>\n<li>Better statistics – listings now display the number of active installs so you can see how many people are actually using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/">overview of the new theme</a> was posted by Scott Reilly.</p>\n<h2>Better Statistics</h2>\n<p>We’ve made huge improvements to <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/stats/">our statistics</a>. This gives us more useful information about the WordPress versions people are using, their PHP version, and their MySQL version.</p>\n<p>Already these new statistics have provided us with useful insights into WordPress usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 43% of all sites are running the latest version of WordPress. Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations. This anomaly was a by-product of spammers.</li>\n<li>Only 15.9% of sites are using PHP 5.2, which is better than we thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the coming months we’ll be able to use these statistics to bring you new tools and improvements, and to make more informed decisions across the board.

The 45-question survey ran for just two weeks in February and the site was able to collect results from more than 26,000 participants.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Stack Overflow survey respondents do not represent a perfect cross section of all developers worldwide, and the overview clearly states the results are skewed by selection bias and language bias, among other biases. However, the site does reach a massive audience of developers, with 32 million visits per month, 25 million of which are return visitors.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents were male (92.1%) who describe their profession as &#8220;Full-stack web developer&#8221; (32.4%), the largest section, followed by student (13.6%), back-end web developer (10.1%), and mobile developer (9.1%).</p>\n<p>WordPress was highlighted as one of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-super" target="_blank">most dreaded technologies</a> of those surveyed, trailing Visual Basic and Salesforce. The term &#8220;most dreaded&#8221; was used to indicate the &#8220;% of devs who are developing with the language or tech but have not expressed interest in continuing to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/most-dreaded.png" rel="prettyphoto[41651]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/most-dreaded.png?resize=1025%2C751" alt="most-dreaded" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41749" /></a></p>\n<p>Given that Stack Overflow generally attracts English-speaking, full-stack developers who enjoy its gamified question and answer format, it&#8217;s not surprising that you would find WordPress listed among the most dreaded technologies.</p>\n<p>There are many things that are done &#8220;the WordPress way,&#8221; which prevent developers from quickly jumping in when they are new to the platform. WordPress&#8217; unwavering commitment to backwards compatibility is also a major turn off for many developers.

They found that those with the most experience points said that being able to work remotely was non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>Based on 16,522 responses, the results indicate that the average developer spends 7+ hours per week coding on the side. &#8220;70% of respondents reported that they spend 2 or more hours per week programming either as a hobby or working on open source software. 20% of respondents spend more than 10 hours programming away from work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41651]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg?resize=715%2C373" alt="side-projects" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41803" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer hunting for a job and you&#8217;re not spending your free time contributing to open source projects or building your own software, your resume and experience may not be as attractive as others who are active on projects outside of work.</p>\n<p>The survey also provides a comprehensive breakdown of compensation by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang" target="_blank">technology</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-geo" target="_blank">purchasing power</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-remote" target="_blank">remote status</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-so" target="_blank">Stack Overflow reputation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41651]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg?resize=713%2C605" alt="compensation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41806" /></a></p>\n<p>Compensation by purchasing power indicates that Ukraine is the top place for developers to live and work, followed by South Africa, USA, Australia, and Russia.

WordPress has been free and open source software from the very beginning, Windows not so much, but we’ve always supported as many platforms as possible and for at least 4 years now you could run WP on Windows and IIS (Internet Information Services).</p>\n<p>Choice and competition are great for spurring innovation and better for users and I believe open source software is a good thing even if it’s on a proprietary platform. (Just like we have an open source <a href="http://iphone.wordpress.org/">iPhone application</a>, or encourage people to use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> on Windows.)</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Supporting the WordPress Community</h2>\n<p>Since 2009, Microsoft has sponsored several WordCamps, meetups, and WordPress specific events.

The Powerbeats 2 are light, have great battery life (they claim 6 hours, that feels about right), stay in place even when running in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Houston#Summer">the Houston heat</a>, charge fast, and as a bonus they look cool. (Beats has always been great about that.) The sound? They&#8217;re bad, but good at it. There&#8217;s basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes, which is actually a bonus, and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out. Buy these for the function, not the sound quality, and you can pick them up from any Best Buy kiosk in the airport or Apple Store if you lose or forget them, so they&#8217;re pretty ubiquitous.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-44930" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg" alt="71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2" width="360" height="340" /></a>I heard about the Sennheisers from <a href="http://carlhancock.com/">Carl Hancock</a> who tried them and gave them a high recommendation. I had trouble finding them but there was a pair local to me at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;H in New York</a> so I got them delivered and I was immediately impressed with them. They&#8217;re better than my <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/beats-studio-wireless-vs-samsung-level-over/">previous wireless over-ear recommendation the Samsung Level Over</a> in every way: sound, size, compatibility, aesthetics, usability, noise canceling.</p>\n<p>The sound is the best I&#8217;ve heard from wireless headphones so far. Just the right balance. The noise canceling apparently uses 4 different mics and I&#8217;ve found it more than sufficient on dozens of plane rides, including passing the noisy baby test. My only complaint is they don&#8217;t &#8220;grip&#8221; my ears as much, so some sound leaks in that way. They fold up to be pretty small, and I just toss them in my backpack. <a href="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-44931 alignleft" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg" alt="81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2" width="252" height="238" /></a>The battery goes <em>forever</em>, or as they claim 22 hours. You really forget to charge these things for a while and they still have plenty of juice. The volume and other controls actually work with the iPhone, and bluetooth calls have sounded great and people can actually hear me. Only downside is they have basically a proprietary connection for their 1/8th inch cable, so you have ta carry that around, but they charge with standard micro-USB.

He is the creator of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This article is based on a few ideas, thoughts and opinions I have about Git and WordPress. There is still no de-facto standard for how these things are dealt with in WordPress and I think it is our responsibility, as a community, to have discussions about them. These are my opinions and I would love to hear yours as well.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>\n<h2>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h2>\n<p>I have ranted about the subject of repository structure before and I have strong opinions about it. In my opinion there is one &#8211; and only one &#8211; way to structure Git repositories in a WordPress context. That one way is the one-package / one-repository approach. Let me explain why.</p>\n<p>While working on WP Pusher, I have seen many different approaches to structuring Git repositories. Two approaches are especially common, and, in my opinion, equally bad.</p>\n<p>The first one is Git-it-all, where everything, including WordPress core, plugins and themes are put under version control. The other one, and more common, is <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control. I say that both of them are equally bad, because no matter what, you are going to have a lot of 3rd party code included in your Git repository, which quickly becomes a mess. Every time WordPress or one of your plugins or themes ships a new update, you will have to somehow deal with it within your version control system.</p>\n<p>The argument for having WordPress itself under version control is most often to lock down the version of the code. This seems a bit redundant to me, since WordPress is already developed using version control (SVN) and comes with a version number for each update. Why would you need to manage that yourself when it is already managed for you? Today, <a href="https://davidwinter.me/install-and-manage-wordpress-with-composer/" target="_blank">installing WordPress with Composer</a> is super easy and then you can control your version from the <code>composer.json</code> file. There are no excuses. Do not include WordPress in your Git repository.</p>\n<p>The second approach, <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control, is often chosen as an easy way of deploying multiple plugins that might depend on each other. Still, I am not buying it. Having 5, 10, or even 20 Git repositories in your <code>wp-content</code> directory is really not an issue. Also, if your plugins depends on each other, take a look at must-use plugins.</p>\n<p>So here is the deal: <strong>You need to treat each of your packages (be it a plugin or a theme) with respect.</strong> You need to give each of them their own Git repository. They are their own entities and needs to be separated. Keeping them locked up together makes it impossible to share code across projects. It is the way Git is supposed to work, it is the way Composer is supposed to work, and it is even the way WordPress itself works.</p>\n<h2>To Ignore, Or Not To Ignore</h2>\n<p>Yes, that is the question and I do not have the answer. I am, of course, talking about the <code>.gitignore</code> file. The file that tells Git which files and directories to exclude from version control. Actually, the real question is: Should you precompile your dependencies before shipping your plugin, or not? (I will focus on PHP dependencies, since I do not know enough about front-end things.)</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, you would never ship something like Composer dependencies with your package. It would be up to the user to compile and fetch those dependencies that fit their specific environment. That is the whole point of dependency management tools. However, in WordPress, there is absolutely no sane way to handle these PHP dependencies. So if you are shipping a WordPress plugin that relies on 3rd party dependencies, I would say &#8220;ship it all&#8221;, even though it feels very wrong and awkward.</p>\n<p>This is <strong><em>bad</em></strong>, though, because what happens when Mailchimp for WordPress ships with one Composer package in v1.0.0 and WP Pusher ships with the same package but v2.0.0? Oh, the horror. The plugin that is loaded first will get to autoload its classes. The others will not (since it would result in a &#8220;class exists&#8221; fatal error). I probably do not need to explain why this is bad.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress developer, you can try to mitigate this by making sure that the functionality you rely on is actually available at runtime, but this is not optimal. However, I really think this is WordPress&#8217; responsibility. We cannot do PHP without using 3rd party code. That would be stupid. So as I said: No clear answer. I guess it just depends.</p>\n<h2>Exporting Repositories aka Zippin&#8217;</h2>\n<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2jzp6k/i_dont_need_your_tests_in_my_production/" target="_blank">someone on Reddit</a> proposed that people start to include a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in their repositories, containing export instructions for Git to use when archiving repositories (zipping them). Basically, by specifying it in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file, you can make Git ignore files that you only need for development.</p>\n<p>The Reddit thread was specifically targeting authors of packages distributed with Composer, but we can use this trick as well. If you exclude files from exports, they will not appear in the zip archives that you can download from GitHub or Bitbucket. This is nifty, especially if you use a tool like my <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> to move files from Git to WordPress, since it can drastically minimize the size of the archive files. No need to ship files such as assets, that are already compiled, and unit tests to end users.</p>\n<p>Here is the <code>.gitattributes</code> file for WP Pusher:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate">/features       export-ignore\n/apache-ci.conf export-ignore\n/behat.yml      export-ignore\n/circle.yml     export-ignore\n/composer.json  export-ignore\n/composer.lock  export-ignore</pre>\n<p>Before I knew about this trick, I manually deleted these files before shipping the plugin. Now it is done automatically.</p>\n<p>There you go. Just a few things I want you to think about and consider if you are a WordPress developer using Git.

The popular caching plugin contains a dangerous persistent XSS vulnerability that was promptly patched in its 1.4.4 release.</p>\n<p>Sucuri ranks the risk as &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model" target="_blank">DREAD</a> score of 8/10. Exploiting the vulnerability is relatively easy for an attacker intent on injecting a backdoor. Sucuri breaks down the technical details of the threat as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using this vulnerability, an attacker using a carefully crafted query could insert malicious scripts to the plugin’s cached file listing page. As this page requires a valid nonce in order to be displayed, a successful exploitation would require the site’s administrator to have a look at that particular section, manually.</p>\n<p>When executed, the injected scripts could be used to perform a lot of other things like adding a new administrator account to the site, injecting backdoors by using WordPress theme edition tools, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WP Super Cache is currently in use on more than a million WordPress sites, according to WordPress.org. If someone is looking to exploit the vulnerability in particular, there would be no shortage of sites to prey upon.</p>\n<p>In the recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites" target="_blank">defacement attacks propagated by ISIL sympathists against WordPress sites</a>, hackers have been capitalizing on the <a href="http://wptavern.com/zero-day-vulnerability-discovered-in-fancybox-for-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">recent vulnerability found in the Fancy Box for WordPress plugin</a>. With just 100,000+ active installations, potentially vulnerably Fancy Box plugin users come in at a small fraction of those affected by the WP Super Cache security issue.</p>\n<p>Short of forcing an automatic plugin update on users, WordPress.org has no way of indicating that one particular plugin update may be more imperative than other routine updates. That&#8217;s why the best practice for site administrators is to keep tabs on your installations and set aside time to update extensions as part of your routine. If you&#8217;re using WP Super Cache, you are advised to update as soon as possible.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 16:30:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: Giving Back to Open Source";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44891";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/giving-back-to-open-source/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:372:"<blockquote><p>Getting out of our ocean to explore the islands of open source is one of the best ways that we can expand our horizons, strengthen our skill sets, and build better relationships.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pippin on <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/giving-back-for-the-future-of-open-source/">why giving back to open source has made his company better</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 04:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: FBI Warns of ISIL Defacement Attacks on WordPress Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4587:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41707]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?resize=1024%2C514" alt="photo credit: Lock - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-40187" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>The FBI issued a public service announcement today, <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150407-1.aspx" target="_blank">warning concerning WordPress website attacks</a> being carried out by individuals sympathetic to the Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL) a.k.a. Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS). The perpetrators of these attacks are defacing sites across various platforms such as news organizations, businesses, government sites, and religious institutions.</p>\n<p>Last month the would-be terrorists gained infamy by <a href="http://wptavern.com/hackers-hijack-fancybox-plugin-to-deface-wordpress-sites-with-isis-propaganda" target="_blank">hijacking the Fancybox Plugin vulnerability in order to deface sites with ISIS propaganda</a>. This particular vulnerability allows malware (or any random script/content) to be added to the vulnerable site and was most recently identified as the entry point for the hackers who injected iframes with ISIS messages.</p>\n<p>A patch exists for the vulnerability and those affected can easily remove the plugin as an alternative. However, many WordPress users are either ignorant of the security issue or indifferent. The FBI&#8217;s announcement serves to warn users of the cost and inconvenience associated with this kind of attack:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although the defacements demonstrate low-level hacking sophistication, they are disruptive and often costly in terms of lost business revenue and expenditures on technical services to repair infected computer systems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement cited multiple plugin vulnerabilities as a security risk to WordPress users but did not identify the plugins for which patches are currently available. Technical details of the brief are limited to a generalized list of consequences should a vulnerable site get hacked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining unauthorized access, bypassing security restrictions, injecting scripts, and stealing cookies from computer systems or network servers. An attacker could install malicious software; manipulate data; or create new accounts with full user privileges for future Web site exploitation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since these are low level hackers exploiting the most basic types of vulnerabilities, they are not targeting specific sites but rather knocking down any open door they can find. The announcement notes that all of the victims of the defacements share common WordPress plugin vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The FBI does not believe that these attacks are actually coming from members of ISIL but instead are coming from hackers using the organization&#8217;s name as a vehicle for greater exposure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The FBI assesses that the perpetrators are not members of the ISIL terrorist organization. These individuals are hackers using relatively unsophisticated methods to exploit technical vulnerabilities and are utilizing the ISIL name to gain more notoriety than the underlying attack would have otherwise garnered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement concludes with a list of general resources for hardening WordPress and identifying vulnerabilities, but the recommendations are vague and non-specific. The best thing that you can do to keep your site safe from these continuing attacks is to make sure you are running the latest version of WordPress. Log in to your sites and update all of your themes and plugins. If you&#8217;re using any commercial plugins or themes, make sure to check for updates in case you are not automatically notified.</p>\n<p>All of the vulnerabilities referenced in the FBI warning already have patches, and all you need to do is update your plugins.

Baeta works as a designer on WordPress.com. Most recently he has been focusing on evolving the brand and preparing its <a href="https://wordpress.com/design-handbook/" target="_blank">design handbook</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the process, things like a unifying typographic modular scale and the Logotype metrics also got some attention &#8211; all in the efforts to unify the brand and make sure it is consistent,&#8221; Baeta said. &#8220;A couple months ago I asked to switch my gears to .org and help the .org universe get a similar treatment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While documenting the colors used by WordPress core, Baeta&#8217;s critical eye for color palettes prompted him to explore some subtle changes that would bring greater harmony to the admin color scheme. If you look carefully, you can see that the new admin colors (on the right) have a more bluish hue than the original MP6 colors (left).</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/color-wpadmin.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41644]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/color-wpadmin.jpg?resize=1025%2C649" alt="color-wpadmin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41666" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to make the grays look intentional and refined, by bringing out a subtle blue hue to them,&#8221; Baeta said. &#8220;I tried to maintain the value (lightness/darkness) of the colors, so that it would be a &#8216;lateral&#8217; evolution. So, technically there isn&#8217;t much change to contrast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A closer look at the HEX changes side-by-side shows the subtle evolution from dusty greys/blues to a more true blue hue:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-admin-colors.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41644]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-admin-colors.jpg?resize=741%2C594" alt="wp-admin-colors" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41675" /></a></p>\n<p>I asked Baeta what his response would be to those who, like one commenter on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2015/04/05/default-admin-color-scheme-update/#comment-24585" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, see the new color scheme as looking &#8220;too bluish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a perception game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The technical reality is the change is incredibly subtle, but depending on your monitor calibration and the way your eyes see color, you&#8217;ll see more/less blue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let me give you an example of a specific hue breakdown &#8211; the main sidebar gray:</p>\n<p><strong>before:</strong>  rgb(51,51,51)<br />\n<strong>after:</strong> rgb(50,55,60)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Each channel goes  0-255 &#8211; so you can see how subtle the change is,&#8221; Baeta explained.</p>\n<p>Feedback from contributors on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31234" target="_blank">ticket</a> where Baeta proposed the changes was overwhelmingly positive and the new color updates will land in 4.2. Core committer Matt Miklic aptly <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2015-02-05T00%3A58%3A50Z&precision=second" target="_blank">summarized</a> the overall consensus:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My subjective feeling is that the shift in colors is so slight, it doesn’t really change the feeling we intended to convey with the original MP6 colors. If anything, it makes the grays look more intentional, a color palette designed to work harmoniously rather than pairing a signature shade of blue with a lot of neutral grays.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Why It&#8217;s Important for Companies and Projects to Iterate on Branding</h3>\n<p>Like it or not, users tend to judge software by how it looks. Even the most minute color choices can affect public perception of an application. Most users are not likely to consciously perceive the changes in this round of WordPress admin iterations, but the improved harmony of the colors will make it easier on the eyes.</p>\n<p>Baeta believes that companies and open source projects need to be open to iterating on their branding every now and then to keep pace with where the web is going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe a brand is something we should cherish very dearly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a project/company&#8217;s most recognizable asset, right?  I think iteration should happen in order to achieve refinement and keep a brand relevant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Specially when a brand doesn&#8217;t begin with a strong set of assets and rules, it allows for the people involved to treat it as they think is best. Eventually atrocities like the fauxgo make everyone regret the absence of rules.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons that Baeta is involved in the initiative to document and refine the project&#8217;s brand through contributions to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/" target="_blank">WordPress.org&#8217;s Design Handbook</a>. Without clear branding guidelines, anyone can take the logo and colors and alter them in ways that muddle the project&#8217;s brand as a whole.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the web has evolved greatly since WordPress first started,&#8221; Baeta said. &#8220;WordPress is now a mature project that deserves to have its very recognizable brand refined and documented to make sure it is protected for years to come.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 19:06:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.4.4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://z9.io/?p=89499439";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://z9.io/2015/04/07/wp-super-cache-1-4-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2258:"<p>WP Super Cache is a full page caching plugin for WordPress.

Obenland&#8217;s latest contribution to WordPress is the <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design">redesigned theme directory</a>. Taylor is largely responsible for the <a title="http://scotty-t.com/2014/04/16/wordpress-3-9-audiovideo/" href="http://scotty-t.com/2014/04/16/wordpress-3-9-audiovideo/">audio and video improvements</a> in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<p>Nacin defines a WordPress release lead as someone who sets the parameters for a release like schedule, deadlines, and helps to decide which feature plugins are merged. They also direct discussions in core development chats, write announcement posts, and shepherds contributions.</p>\n<p>Usually, release leads are not chosen until the beginning of the next development cycle. However, so many people volunteered to lead WordPress 4.2, it gave the team an opportunity to choose them in advance.</p>\n<p>Obenland says it&#8217;s too early to determine what he will focus on for WordPress 4.3, but there may be some incremental flow and user experience improvements.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m still in the process of gathering information and getting a feel for what’s cooking and what could be ready for 4.3. As of right now (three days into the process) there is no clear headline feature emerging but it looks like there will be a number of nice incremental flow and user experience improvements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Obenland what it means to him and the WordPress project for release leads to be chosen this far in advance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First of all it means I actually get to do the above, plan ahead of time. So far, Release Lead appointments happened somewhat last minute so there wasn’t a lot of time to prepare. I now have the luxury of being able to compose a list of proposed features ahead of the kick-off meeting, rather than having to come up with that list during the meeting, which will hopefully lead to a more efficient discussion and evaluation of those features.</p>\n<p>Scott is able to groom feature plugins to get them ready for 4.4, which has been the goal for Release Leads for a while. Going forward, we’ll be in a position where not only Release Leads, but the community, get a chance to plan ahead more than one release at a time. This should have a positive impact on the quality of feature plugins and make for less hurried merges.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Choosing release leads in advance removes friction and enables a smoother transition from one lead to another. It also gives the core team momentum to transfer from one development cycle to the next.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how this impacts feature plugin development and whether or not the team will be able to maintain momentum into the WordPress 4.5 dev cycle.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 21:58:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.2 Will Natively Support Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41600";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://wptavern.com/emoji-enables-wordpress-to-natively-support-chinese-korean-and-japanese-characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2661:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/emoji.png" rel="prettyphoto[41600]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33173" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/emoji.png?resize=620%2C420" alt="emoji" /></a>WordPress 4.2 will soon be released with <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-on-track-to-expand-core-support-for-emoji" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-on-track-to-expand-core-support-for-emoji">expanded core support for emoji</a>, a new feature that users either love or love to hate.

At that time many of their themes had issues that would preclude them from being hosted in the official directory.</p>\n<p>The team has been hard at work bringing their themes up to snuff and now have two that have passed the WordPress Theme Review Team&#8217;s guidelines. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/gridsby/" target="_blank">Gridsby</a>, a theme for photographers, is ModernTheme&#8217;s latest release.</p>\n<p>The theme takes your photographs and arranges them in a mobile-friendly Masonry.js-powered grid on the homepage, followed by optional widget areas and a blog section. Site navigation is hidden behind a slide-out panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby.png" rel="prettyphoto[41558]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="gridsby" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41560" /></a></p>\n<p>Gridsby was created to be flexible and easy for users to personalize. The theme includes a impressive array of customization options available in the native customizer, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload a logo to replace the default site name and description in the header</li>\n<li>Upload your site favicon and Apple Icons</li>\n<li>Add social media links and customize icon color and hover color</li>\n<li>Hide gallery and/or blog section on the homepage</li>\n<li>Display your posts in ascending or descending order</li>\n<li>Customize View More button text and gallery button URL</li>\n<li>Show/hide homepage widgets, set number of columns and customize widgets background and button text</li>\n<li>Add footer contact info</li>\n<li>Customize typography with a selection of Google fonts</li>\n<li>Customize colors for text, links, blockquotes, accents, navigation, etc.</li>\n<li>Set blog excerpt length and Read More text</li>\n<li>Add a background image</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to its unusually long list of customization options, Gridsby authors created documentation, including tutorial videos for setting up its various features. The documentation is easily accessible from the WordPress admin under the Appearance menu:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby-documentation.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41558]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby-documentation.jpg?resize=907%2C418" alt="gridsby-documentation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41608" /></a></p>\n<p>Gridsby works nicely as a theme for displaying photographs but could easily be tailored to work as a portfolio or similar visual showcase. I would not advise using this theme unless you are  committed to procuring large images for the galleries and blog post featured images.

The professional theme review service launched at the beginning of January and has been growing steadily, thanks in part to <a href="http://wptavern.com/themereview-co-inks-strategic-deal-with-studiopress-and-envato" target="_blank">strategic recommendations from Envato and StudioPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Uzelac and Tadlock are both senior reviewers at WordPress.org, and Tadlock is also a prolific plugin developer and co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>. The two are currently testing the waters in branching out into plugin reviews and will only be accepting a limited number of customers until they&#8217;ve nailed down a definitive pricing structure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People have been asking about plugin reviews since day 1,&#8221; Tadlock told the Tavern. &#8220;It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve both been thinking about. Therefore, we decided to do a soft launch of the service.  We need to get a few reviews under our belt to <em>standardize</em> our service, so to speak.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ThemeReview.co will be using <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards" target="_blank">WordPress Coding Standards</a> as the basic criteria for plugin reviews. However, plugin architecture is less rigorously regulated than theme code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, there&#8217;s no standard set of guidelines like we have with themes,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could create those guidelines. Plugins are so vastly different that there&#8217;s no way to know what we&#8217;ll be reviewing from one plugin to the next.  However, some things we&#8217;ve done with theme reviews will carry over into plugins such as using standard WordPress APIs, validating/sanitizing data, and licensing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the WordPress code quality review business, then plugin developers are a vast market you would be remiss to leave untapped. If you take WordPress.org as an example, themes make up roughly 10% of listings (~3,000) as compared to plugins (~37,000). Outside of WordPress.org&#8217;s small selection of extensions, there are thousands more products, both commercial and free.</p>\n<p>So far, the theme review aspect of the business has been moderately successful. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made more than Theme Hybrid, my first foray into a professional WordPress service, did in it&#8217;s first few months,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;However, we&#8217;re not quite at that point of where Emil and I could do this full time yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As plugins are the very close cousin of themes, their addition is a natural pivot for the theme review duo. Plugin products have also increasingly become a larger portion of the profits for theme development shops, such as WooThemes and iThemes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually more excited about plugin reviews because it&#8217;s a bit like venturing out into the Wild West,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>While respected plugin developers such as Pippin Williamson have offered contract assistance in helping plugin authors review and improve their work, no business has tackled plugin code reviews as one of its primary services. <a href="http://themereview.co/" target="_blank">ThemeReview.co</a> will be the first to attempt to standardize this process. For the time being, the company will provide custom quotes for reviews, based on the amount and complexity of the code.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 17:04:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Matt: Meat Drunk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44905";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/meat-drunk/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:131:"<p>Have you heard <em><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/meat-drunk-bbq-expert-much-good-thing/">of being meat drunk</a>?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 05 Apr 2015 21:26:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Alcohol or Marijuana?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44908";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/alcohol-or-marijuana/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:380:"<blockquote><p>It would be nice to imagine your children won’t abuse any substances, but also unrealistic.

Michael Arestad <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/">proposed the revamp</a> back in February and more than 15 contributors have helped out with the project.</p>\n\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design/oldpressthis"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OldPressThis.png?fit=500%2C500" class="attachment-large" alt="Old PressThis" /></a>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design/newpressthis"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThis.png?fit=500%2C500" class="attachment-large" alt="New PressThis" /></a>\n\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above (old PressThis on the left and new PressThis on the right), PressThis has a new user interface and minimalist design. Post meta boxes are replaced with menus that slide from left to right when clicked. The post editor has the bare essential formatting buttons and the add media button is in the bottom left corner.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThisWithContent.png" rel="prettyphoto[41517]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41529" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThisWithContent.png?resize=1025%2C857" alt="New PressThis With Content" /></a>New PressThis With Content\n<p>When you select PressThis on a post or page, the title, source, and highlighted content will automatically be inserted into the editor. If the article uses images, you&#8217;ll see a list of ones to choose from below the post title.</p>\n<p>Although images are initially inserted using a URL, they&#8217;re automatically uploaded to the local WordPress media library once a post is published or saved as a draft. Not only is this a convenient feature, but it also prevents <a title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking" href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking">hot linking</a>.</p>\n<p>While testing PressThis, I found it to be fast and a pleasure to use. If you plan on using it as your primary post editor, keep in mind that it doesn&#8217;t have a way to add featured images. It&#8217;s possible this will be added in a future version.</p>\n<h2>PressThis is More Than Just a Bookmarklet</h2>\n<p>While using PressThis, I discovered that it&#8217;s more than just a bookmarklet; it&#8217;s also an experimental post editor.

Sometimes members are too lazy to upload a profile photo, no matter how many friendly prompts you try to offer.</p>\n<p>Missing profile images makes for ugly directory pages and less colorful BuddyPress widgets. It makes it seem like users aren&#8217;t invested enough in your site to bother with having an avatar. A widespread lack of avatars has a subtle damaging effect on both members and non-members&#8217; perceptions of your community.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Brajesh Singh, owner of <a href="http://buddydev.com/" target="_blank">BuddyDev</a>, created the <a href="http://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-force-profile-photo/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Force Profile Photo</a> plugin.

Although he talks about the industry as a whole, MacGloinn says the need for specialized WordPress hosting is quickly disappearing.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class="s1">With the lingering perception that this stuff must be difficult, and the customer’s delight with all that WordPress can do these days, the specialist WordPress hosts get a lot more credit than they deserve.</span></p>\n<p><span class="s1">The problem is that modern technologies are rapidly rendering their role unnecessary. Anyone can now go to Linode or Digital Ocean and fire up their own VPS (Virtual Private Server) within half a minute, for a fraction of the approximately $30 cost of the most basic, one-WordPress-installation package from a specialist WordPress host. </span></p>\n<p><span class="s1">The VPS user can then use Docker or a similar technology to instantly install all they need for any number of secure, optimized installations of WordPress, all running with more memory, storage and bandwidth. The dirty secret of the specialist WordPress hosting industry: this is exactly what most of them are doing themselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>If specialized WordPress hosts rely on cloud infrastructure services like Amazon Web Services and charge a premium to customers, what stops Amazon from providing a great managed WordPress hosting experience, thereby eliminating the middleman? As MacGloinn points out, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have already made moves to provide the best out-of-the box experience.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Just last Friday, Google announced Google Cloud Launcher, enabling push-button deployment of over 120 top Open Source applications, including WordPress, to the Google Cloud Platform. Just two days before that, Microsoft launched the Azure App Service, which does essentially the same thing from a slightly different angle.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>VPS (Virtual Private Servers) and other technical jargon is scary to a lot of people, but if companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft can provide a great out-of-the box experience and charge a significantly lower price compared to specialized hosts, it&#8217;s possible the managed WordPress hosting space could disappear.</p>\n<p>The article has a <a title="http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments" href="http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments">few comments</a> from readers and offers a lot of food for thought, but I really want to hear from those who own and operate specialized WordPress hosting companies.

Their qualitative analysis, titled <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mlw/pubs/icwsm2014-favouriting.pdf" target="_blank">More than Liking and Bookmarking? Towards Understanding Twitter Favouriting Behaviour</a>, dissects the various motivations for using the feature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The survey responses from these users demonstrate that motives for favouriting tweets are extremely heterogeneous and not always consistent within and between users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although many other apps and websites have offered favoriting for years, this study on Twitter favoriting was one of the first to reveal just how complex and nuanced the feature can become in the hands of users.</p>\n<h3>Add Favorites to WordPress Posts</h3>\n<p>Favoriting is a subjective activity that is interpreted purely by individual motivation. The simple act of pushing a button results in a myriad of functional and communicative uses, making it one of the more interesting interactive features that you can add to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Favoriting capabilities are especially important when it comes to custom post types. Not every site needs this feature, but it is particularly helpful for those with large amounts of content stored in custom post types, such as books, recipes, movies, jobs, or real estate listings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/favorites/" target="_blank">Favorites</a> is a new plugin that was released last month on WordPress.org. It is easy for end users to set up but was also created with developers in mind. The plugin provides an API for adding a favorite button to any post type.</p>\n<p>The Favorites settings panel allows you to select the post types where you want favoriting functionality to apply. You can also customize the button text in order to make it suitable for bookmarking, liking, favoriting, or any other similar use.</p>\n<p>Favorites will automatically add a favorite button at the top or bottom of your posts. The button intuitively takes on the styles of your active theme, as you can see in this example with the <a href="http://wptavern.com/hew-a-free-wordpress-blogging-theme-inspired-by-ryu">Hew</a> theme:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40043]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg?resize=837%2C504" alt="favorite-button-on-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41485" /></a></p>\n<p>Use of the plugin requires WordPress version 3.8+ and PHP version 5.3.2+. <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kylephillips" target="_blank">Kyle Phillips</a>, author of Favorites, summarized the features to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use with Any Post Type</strong> &#8211; Enable or disable favorite functionality per post type while automatically adding a favorite button before and/or after the content. Alternatively, you can use the included functions to display the button anywhere in your template.</li>\n<li><strong>Available for All Users</strong> – Don&#8217;t want to hide functionality behind a login? Favorites includes an option to save anonymous users&#8217; favorites by either Session or Cookie. Logged-In users&#8217; favorites are also saved as user meta.</li>\n<li><strong>Designed for Developers</strong> &#8211; Favorites works great out of the box for beginners, but a full set of template functions unlocks just about any sort of custom functionality developers may need. Favorites outputs the minimum amount of markup needed, putting the style and control in your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Phillip set up the <a href="https://favoriteposts.com/" target="_blank">favoriteposts.com</a> site to house documentation for the plugin, including options, settings, available shortcodes, and a function reference for outputting the button, favorite counts, and a list of user favorites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png" rel="prettyphoto[40043]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png?resize=900%2C726" alt="screenshot-3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41495" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering if Favorites is compatible with your caching solution, the short answer is &#8216;yes,&#8217; according to the plugin&#8217;s FAQ page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, although the buttons may display the incorrect state momentarily. Button states are updated via an AJAX call after page load in order to accommodate cached pages. This may be noticeable on slower servers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After having tried many different post bookmarking plugins for WordPress, I found Favorites to be the easiest one to use with the most intuitive button display.

Her session encouraged those in attendance to build bridges between technology communities.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>Wong came to WordPress from the PHP community and her presentation addressed the friction that is often present between the two. I spoke with her about the inspiration behind her topic and the deeper issues underlying the general lack of understanding between the two communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lots of people have used WordPress when it was young &#8211; maybe before all the beautiful UI came in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am not one of those people, but I&#8217;ve heard the stories of how bad the UX was.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some people learned to live with it and became part of the WP community; some people hated it and left. The people who left have a particular ideal of WordPress from their very old experience and unless we as a community reach out to them, their perceptions will not change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She believes that WordPress contributors should strive to attend and speak at non-WordCamp conferences to learn from and experience other communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Inside the WP community I often hear, &#8216;How do you become better at PHP?&#8217; <span class="pullquote alignleft">We need to show them that the WP community is welcomed by the PHP community and that it is not a scary place</span>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The situation is gradually improving across many events, as ZendCon <a href="https://twitter.com/zendcon/status/583638815237087232" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it will be including a WordPress track. WordPress community members made an effort to attend <a href="http://world.phparch.com/" target="_blank">PHP World 2014</a>, PHP developer <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/" target="_blank">Lorna Jane Mitchell</a> spoke at WordCamp London, and PHP South West (a user group in the UK) recently had a joint night with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-WordPress-People/" target="_blank">Bristol WordPress People</a> user group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing more and more of this cross pollination, at least between the WP and PHP community, slowly,&#8221; Wong said.</p>\n<h3>Venturing Outside the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Speaking at WordCamps is an excellent way to give back and connect with others in the community, but the value of venturing outside of the WordPress bubble is often overlooked. Aaron Jorbin attended the PHP UK conference knowing only one person.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there is a personal benefit in putting ourselves in situations we aren&#8217;t automatically comfortable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to knowing a lot of people at events. Knowing only one person before hand helps me do a better job of empathizing with people that feel like outsiders at WordPress events. <span class="pullquote alignleft">If we want to do a better job of creating diversity, it&#8217;s good to feel the problems people feel when they don&#8217;t feel like they belong.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jorbin spoke on Modernizing the WordPress Toolbox. His presentation goes far beyond the topic of modernizing WordPress&#8217; build tools to include his passion for removing barriers to contributing to the project. Jorbin also delved deeper into the reasons behind the project&#8217;s selection of certain tools.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;We as a community need to do a better job of both getting out there and bringing people in,&#8221; Jorbin said.  &#8220;This is something that we have improved over the last few years (Nacin keynoting PHP Tech, Joe Dolson and Joseph O&#8217;Connor at CSUN, Mel Choyce, Nacin and myself at OS Bridge, etc.), but we have a long way to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Currently, going outside of the WordPress space usually means that you will encounter some negative opinions about WordPress. Jorbin said that these are largely born out of a lack of knowledge of WordPress and why contributors make the decisions that they make.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PHP developers hear things like PHP 5.2 as a minimum and write us off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When they hear that 1) We run just fine on PHP 5.6, and 2) are already running our automated tests on php7, and 3) that we do it based on our user focused philosophies, they understand it and actually gain a lot of respect for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond combating negative opinions of the software, Jorbin believes that the WordPress community can find a wealth of knowledge outside of WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another benefit is hearing how other projects are solving problems helps WordPress solve problems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hearing about <a href="http://drupalladder.org/" target="_blank">The Drupal Ladder</a> influences how I think about on-boarding new contributors. Hearing about how Etsy started using HHVM helps me get ideas for rolling out HHVM on WordPress sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you make the effort to venture outside of your usual networks, you will undoubtedly encounter situations wherein your skills of diplomacy and bridge-building will be sharpened, as both Wong and Jorbin found at the PHP UK conference. However, the value gained in connecting with other communities far outweighs the challenges. The WordPress community has a great deal to share with the world, but it is also enriched by other technologies.</p>\n<p>If you already speak at multiple WordCamps per year, here&#8217;s a new challenge for 2015: Speak at a conference outside the WordPress bubble where you may not know many people. Who knows who you&#8217;ll meet or what you might learn?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 23:37:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Warped Silicon Valley";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44898";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/warped-silicon-valley/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:441:"<p>As a counterpoint to yesterday&#8217;s link to the Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, here&#8217;s a Washington Post story, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-one-mans-utopian-vision-for-the-internet-conquered-and-then-badly-warped-silicon-valley/2015/03/20/7dbe39f8-cdab-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html">Meet the man whose utopian vision for the Internet conquered, and then warped, Silicon Valley</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 20:41:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Display Sheet Music in WordPress With the ABC Notation Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41412";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wptavern.com/display-sheet-music-in-wordpress-with-the-abc-notation-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1777:"<p>If you&#8217;re a musician or a music teacher and want to show sheet music in WordPress, you might be interested in a new plugin <a title="http://wordpress.paulrosen.net/plugins/abc-notation/" href="http://wordpress.paulrosen.net/plugins/abc-notation/">developed by Paul Rosen</a> called <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/abc-notation/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/abc-notation/">ABC Notation</a>.

The new theme, designed by <a href="http://soakingupthelight.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ola Laczek</a>, was inspired by <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/ryu" target="_blank">Ryu</a>, a classic among personal blogging themes.

I wanted to create a personal-blogging theme which shows an author’s identity – via Gravatar logo and social media links in the header – while staying focused on their content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme includes one optional custom menu in the top bar, which is displayed to the left of the social links menu. Hew keeps the focus on content by hiding all four of its widget areas within a slide-out top panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png" rel="prettyphoto[41372]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png?resize=640%2C284" alt="hew-top-widgets" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41388" /></a></p>\n<p>As is the case with virtually every other recent theme release from WordPress.com, Hew includes support for post formats. The theme prominently features post format icons at the top of every post. Each format has its own subtle differences in style.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41372]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg?resize=986%2C421" alt="hew-quote-post-formats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41392" /></a></p>\n<p>Hew&#8217;s customizer options include the ability to change the header image from your Gravatar to something else, as well as the ability to customize the background and header text color. If you&#8217;re hoping to be able to change the yellow highlight color used throughout the theme, I didn&#8217;t see an easy option to do this.

Aleksić is a growth researcher and analyst at <a href="https://managewp.com/" target="_blank">ManageWP</a> by day but also has a passion for design.</p>\n<p>Despite having worked with WordPress for a few years, his first contact with the community was at <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2014</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was blown away by the positive attitude of the people there (especially Remkus de Vries and Chris Lema &#8211; those two are a force of nature) and decided I wanted to be a part of it,&#8221; Aleksić said. When he found out about WordCamp Belgrade getting approved, he decided to offer his help to Milan Ivanović and the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of creating our own Wapuu several times in the past, but it wasn&#8217;t until I read your article on <a href="http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015" target="_blank">Scott Evans&#8217; punk Wapuu</a> that I finally decided to do something about it,&#8221; Aleksić said. &#8220;I sat down with my colleague <a href="https://www.behance.net/milica_spasojevic" target="_blank">Milica</a>  and created Wapuujlo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wapuujlo&#8217;s attire represents a melding of Serbian tradition with the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing. Aleksić explained his inspiration for the mascot&#8217;s design:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The hat šajkača, a traditional Serbian hat worn by the common folk back in the day, was a logical choice because it represents the people using WordPress to have their voices heard. The plum was Milica&#8217;s idea &#8211; it&#8217;s our national symbol, representing prosperity and unity. These two ideas gave Wapuujlo a traditional vibe, which is a nice contrast to the futuristic/anime variants of the Japanese Wapuu. Even the name Wapuujlo is a nod to traditional Serbian names.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Aleksić found the wapuu SVG file to be easy to alter and the team was able to perform the changes in under five minutes. &#8220;I expect that Belgrade, London, and Philly wapuus will prompt other WordPress communities to come up with their own versions of the mascot,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just don&#8217;t go overboard with the alterations: keep it clean, simple and recognizable,&#8221; Aleksić advised those who want to design a wapuu mascot for an event.</p>\n<p>The trend of creating custom mascots for WordCamps seems to be rapidly catching on outside of Japan. The first edition of WordCamp Belgrade is a historic event for <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">Serbia&#8217;s WordPress community</a> and the organizers wanted to offer a commemorative wapuu sticker as part of the branding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to continue the tradition and inspire other WordCamps out there to include Wapuu as a must,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;I just love that cute little fellow!&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 00:14:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: How to Use LICEcap to Record and Turn Screen Captures into Animated GIFs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41316";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-use-licecap-to-record-and-turn-screen-captures-into-animated-gifs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3800:"<p>When I wrote about <a title="http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2" href="http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2">enhanced plugin installs being removed</a> from WordPress 4.2 last week, a few readers asked how I created the animated image that shows how shiny updates work. I used <a title="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/" href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> by Çockos Incorporated, which is free, GPL licensed software available for Windows and OSX.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41321" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png?resize=648%2C508" alt="LICEcap Frame" /></a>LICEcap Frame\n<p>LICEcap has an adjustable frame that you place over the content you want to record. You can adjust the frame manually by dragging the edges with your mouse cursor, or you can type in an exact size. You can also adjust the max frames per second, but keep in mind that the higher the number, the larger the file size will be.</p>\n<p>When you hit the record button, you&#8217;ll be prompted to name the file and select where it will be saved. There&#8217;s also configuration settings that allow you to manipulate the recording.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41322" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png?resize=660%2C222" alt="Recording Settings" /></a>Recording Settings\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what most of the options do and LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have any documentation outside of <a title="http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44" href="http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44">this discussion forum</a>. I recommend checking the box to use Control + Alt + P to pause the recording. This way, you won&#8217;t see the mouse cursor move off the screen to click the pause button. LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have an editor to manage frames so if you make a mistake, you&#8217;ll have to start over. Since animated GIFs should be as short and small as possible, the lack of a frame editor isn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>\n<p>Once everything is configured, click the save button and a three second countdown begins. When the countdown reaches 0, LICEcap begins recording movement within the frame. On the bottom left of the recording window, you&#8217;ll see the size of the frame, timestamp, and the amount of FPS.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41323" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png?resize=693%2C557" alt="Recording Status " /></a>Recording Status\n<p>Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the recording, upload the GIF file to the WordPress media library. When you insert it into a post, make sure to use the full size image since animated GIFs don&#8217;t scale as well as JPG files.</p>\n<h2>A Few Tips When Creating Animated GIFs</h2>\n<p>Keep the recording as short and small as possible. Resize the recording window so it&#8217;s only as big as necessary. Animation such as scrolling and page browsing should be kept to a minimum. Last but not least, play with the recording options as there might be a combination that decreases the file size of recordings.</p>\n<p>Animated GIFs are great for a few laughs, but they&#8217;re also an excellent way to show how something works.

The session should make it onto WordPress.tv sometime soon, but in the meantime he created a screencast for those who couldn&#8217;t attend.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://jacklenox.com/2015/03/30/building-themes-with-the-wp-rest-api-wordcamp-london-march-2015/" target="_blank">video</a> is actually an extended edition of his talk and runs for a full 50 minutes. Lenox starts by answering the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal about the REST API?&#8221; He also demos the speed of getting content from the API using a few live examples.</p>\n<p>His presentation offers theme developers a few reasons for why they may want to look into building themes that use the WP REST API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides a way to retrieve pure data (usually in JSON or XML format) over HTTP</li>\n<li>No loops necessary</li>\n<li>Good for mobile apps and environments where you don&#8217;t want a full webpage to render but want content from a blog or site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lenox gives a basic overview of what can you do with the WP REST API, even without knowing any PHP. The benefits he cites include a more engaging user experience, potentially reduced server load, improved speed, and better control over failed connections. During the presentation he shows examples of how to incorporate single page application elements into WordPress themes where interactions are handled by JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The Picard theme that he demos is aptly named as a play on the next generation of themes. It&#8217;s a prototype WordPress theme built with React and the upcoming WP-API. If you want to play with it, you can clone the repository on <a href="https://github.com/jacklenox/picard-present" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Automattic is aiming to open source the Picard theme around the beginning of May.</p>\n<p>Interest surrounding the presentation demonstrates how excited the WordPress community is to start incorporating the new API into their projects. Many who attended the session at WordCamp London were inspired to start looking at themes in a new way.</p>\n<p>The resulting experience of pre-loading all the content allows users to zip around without any delay. It&#8217;s a dramatic improvement and an amazing example of how a theme can have much more control over the speed and resources needed to present content on the frontend.

The move is in response to requests from its community and recognizing it has become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historical content.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve been proud to support Creative Commons licenses since 2004, and we’ve become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historic images from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums around the world (check out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">The Flickr Commons</a> for examples).</p>\n<p>But we’ve heard from our community that we’re missing two important designations: Public Domain and Creative Commons 0 (CC0). Many members of our community want to be able to upload images that are no longer protected by copyright and correctly tag them as being in the Public Domain, or they want to release their copyright entirely under CC0.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a title="http://www.spacex.com/" href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> is the first <a title="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos">Flickr account</a> to change its image designation to CC0.

Flickr only provides four different search filters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any License</li>\n<li>Creative Commons Only</li>\n<li>  Commercial use allowed</li>\n<li>  Modifications allowed</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png" rel="prettyphoto[41269]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41274" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png?resize=1025%2C423" alt="Lack of Search Filters" /></a>Lack of Search Filters\n<p>Since CC0 is mixed in the other Creative Commons license types, it&#8217;s difficult to search only for images with the CC0 and Public Domain designations. Until Flickr adds specific license filters to its search box, users will likely spend more time searching for images instead of using them.</p>\n<p>Despite not being able to easily find them, enabling users to waive all copyright protection on photographs should increase the amount of freely available images to use. This is a huge win and in the future, could make Flickr the largest source of Public Domain images on the web.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 01:24:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"Post Status: How StoryCorps uses WordPress to enable storytelling everywhere";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=12142";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://poststatus.com/how-storycorps-uses-wordpress-to-enable-storytelling-everywhere/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10814:"<p><a href="http://storycorps.org/">StoryCorps</a> is an organization that aims &#8220;to provide people of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share and preserve the stories of our lives.&#8221; Featured stories are broadcast nationally on NPR.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps has published more than 50,000 interviews with almost 100,000 participants since they launched in 2003.

The stories tend to be very powerful. I was nearly brought to tears by one where <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/i-just-hugged-the-man-who-murdered-my-son/">a lady hugs her son&#8217;s murderer</a>. Another moving story (from my hometown no less), features a father that <a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/william-watford-iii-and-deidra-robinson/">comes to terms with his daughter&#8217;s homosexuality</a>. Or there&#8217;s one where President Obama<a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/noah-mcqueen-and-barack-obama-150225/"> interviews a boy who overcame adversity to join My Brother&#8217;s Keeper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Record stories anywhere</h3>\n<p>The latest initiative for creating ways for people to share their story is via <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a>, a website and companion apps that make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to record an interview and publish it.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps.me is built on WordPress, and utilizes the <a title="The WordPress REST API" href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/">WordPress REST API</a> to enable access to a customized content architecture. The StoryCorps app utilizes the API to consume data and publish stories from the app back to the website.</p>\n<p>I interviewed Dean Haddock, Director of Digital &amp; Technical Innovation at StoryCorps, about how the idea for the app came about, how they use and think of WordPress, and other insights from their short three month development period.</p>\n<p>Listen to the interview:</p>\n<a href="https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3">https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3</a>\n<p><a href="https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>\n<h3>A national day of listening</h3>\n<p>Dean says he thinks the StoryCorps app really dates back to a program they ran three years ago called A National Day of Listening, where instead of shopping on Black Friday, they hosted an event where people could tell stories.</p>\n<p>Dean&#8217;s team expanding on the idea, and the event turned <a href="http://diy.storycorps.org/">into a micro-site</a> using SoundCloud&#8217;s API that made that process easier. That project eventually expanded into the idea that would become StoryCorps.me.</p>\n<h3>Funding for the app</h3>\n<p>The StoryCorps app was funded thanks to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay winning this year’s TED Prize, with a substantial amount of research and development conducted under the 2014 Knight Foundation Prototype Award. He gave a TED Talk in Vancouver just a few weeks ago, where he shared how <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en">everyone has a story to tell</a>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_12145" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en"><img class="wp-image-12145 size-large" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dave-isay-752x391.png" alt="Dave Isay at TED" width="752" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dave Isay at TED</p></div>\n<blockquote><p>The TED Prize is awarded to an individual with a creative, bold vision to spark global change. By leveraging the TED community’s resources and investing $1 million into a powerful idea, each year the TED Prize supports one wish to inspire the world.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize">- TED Prize website</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>His wish after winning the TED Prize was to &#8220;to grow this digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity.&#8221; During the TED Talk, he noted that StoryCorps is &#8220;the single largest collection of human voices ever collected.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new app makes this mission even more plausible, by having almost no barrier for interview creation. The $1 million TED Prize made it possible.</p>\n<h3>Development of the StoryCorps app</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12146" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/storycorps-app-752x444.jpg" alt="storycorps-app" width="752" height="444" /></p>\n<p>With &#8220;one tap&#8221;, interviews can be created and uploaded to the StoryCorps.me website and the Library of Congress archive.</p>\n<p>Dave shared some of his vision for the app during the TED Talk:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id="t-1069355" class="talk-transcript__fragment">Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment</span> <span id="t-1073093" class="talk-transcript__fragment">where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country</span> <span id="t-1077087" class="talk-transcript__fragment">records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,</span> <span id="t-1079989" class="talk-transcript__fragment">so that in one single weekend</span> <span id="t-1082892" class="talk-transcript__fragment">an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Development of the app was managed on three levels.</p>\n<p>The StoryCorps team did project management, communication, and handled RFPs for app and website development. They also ensured that everything fit the StoryCorps model, and ensured that the new website and app talked to existing StoryCorps software and APIs properly.</p>\n<p><a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> built the website infrastructure, manages scalability issues, and managed the integration of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p><a href="http://maya.com/news/maya-creates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanityreates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanity">MAYA design</a> designed and built the app for the end-user, utilizing PhoneGap so that the app could be launched simultaneously to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;We knew we going to use WordPress before we started looking for partners to help us build this thing.&#8221;</span> As a &#8220;small to midsize non-profit,&#8221; StoryCorps has few resources. StoryCorps.org has been on WordPress, and they wanted to use WordPress for StoryCorps.me as well.</p>\n<p>The development phase was quite short: from funding to launch took only three months. They launched at TED after receiving the funding last October.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For public facing web technology, WordPress is so flexible and so malleable and amenable to whatever we need to do with it, that it really wasn&#8217;t much of a question whether this was the right platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What their real question was, Dean shares, was how WordPress could scale if and when they hit a million users, and that&#8217;s why they brought in 10up.</p>\n<h3>What they learned</h3>\n<p>They are really pleased with how the project has gone so far. However, not everything was a success. They had to pivot and make adjustments as they went along and learned new things and requirements.</p>\n<p>Dean noted, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;You have to be willing to completely submit to the process.&#8221;</span> He says it wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded if 10up and Maya weren&#8217;t committed as StoryCorps to the success of the project.</p>\n<p>They also learned what Dean calls &#8220;more tangible&#8221; things, like the usage of PhoneGap. Without using a tool like PhoneGap, they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to &#8220;get to market as soon as possible.&#8221; However, he admits the app could be slightly better if it were built in a native platform to either iOS or Android.</p>\n<h3>Powerful stories</h3>\n<p>I really enjoyed digging into StoryCorps mission and the new <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a> project. I&#8217;m addicted to their stories, and some of the stories that have been uploaded &#8212; such as <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/krisalyn-cut-her-hair/">those</a> <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/grandmas-favorite-memories/">in</a> the audio intro &#8212; are really endearing.</p>\n<p>While there may be an element of noise to the StoryCorps.me archive, it&#8217;s already evident that many gems will emerge, and who knows what ideas people will come up with for creative ways to perform interviews and record stories.</p>\n<p>The apps are available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bottlerocketapps.storycorps">Google Play</a> and in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storycorps/id359071069?mt=8">App Store</a>. It&#8217;ll be improving over the next weeks and and months. If you&#8217;re excited about technology at StoryCorps, you can reach Dean at <a href="mailto:dhaddock@storycorps.org">dhaddock@storycorps.org</a> or you can also report issues or ask questions about the app at <a href="mailto:contactus@storycorps.me">contactus@storycorps.me</a>.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps is a great testament to WordPress and its ability to be an infrastructure to an app at scale, while also enabling efficient development cycles. This is probably my favorite utilization of the new REST API yet.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 23:21:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:111:"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Directory Improvements Boost User Engagement, Commercial Themes Page Still Recovering";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41237";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-improvements-boost-user-engagement-commercial-themes-page-still-recovering";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3991:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/new-themes-directory-featured.png" rel="prettyphoto[41237]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/new-themes-directory-featured.png?resize=1001%2C489" alt="new-themes-directory-featured" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37113" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org launched <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design" target="_blank">a new design for the Theme Directory</a> just over a month ago and the meta team has continued to fix bugs and add enhancements. Preliminary stats and feedback indicate that the directory improvements have had a positive impact on users&#8217; ability to hunt for themes.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org contributor Konstantin Obenland <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/" target="_blank">reports</a> that user engagement has taken a significant jump:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Users stay longer on the site, look at a lot more pages, and are way less likely to leave without any interaction. Comparing the week before the relaunch with this past week, session duration is up 9%. The amount of pages a user looks at is up 34%. And the overall bounce rate went down from ~30% to under 10%. Even on the homepage, where the bounce rate was at around 45%, we can see that drop by 2/3.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new design has not affected the directory&#8217;s search engine ranking or download numbers. Obenland states that visitor numbers remain constant, as do search engine referral numbers and theme downloads.</p>\n<p>While the new image-heavy grid design makes it easier for users to find the best themes on WordPress.org, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/commercial/" target="_blank">Commercial Themes</a> page has suffered a sharp decline in stats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Commercial Themes page saw a drop of ~40% in visitors between the old Directory and the new,&#8221; Obenland said. &#8220;That number was at 60% right after launch, but it recovered and continues to recover with some adjustments we made to the link placement on the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the prominent placement of &#8220;Commercial Themes&#8221; link on the main theme directory page, users are spending more time browsing for free themes. The previous design of the directory made it tedious to search for a new theme, but it&#8217;s likely that the new UI is helping users to discover how many truly beautiful, high quality free themes are available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The Commercial Themes page received the same UI updates as the main directory, but the chief complaint from commercial theme developers following the design switch was the <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/947" target="_blank">placement and labeling of the link</a>. This particular aspect of the design has been iterated upon several times since the launch.</p>\n<p>However, relentlessly pursuing better stats for commercial theme shops is contrary to the purpose of the WordPress theme directory, according to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design#comment-65597" target="_blank">an email reply</a> received by one concerned user who contacted themes@wordpress.org:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal wouldn’t be to maximize traffic to the sites listed on the commercial page so much as making the site as functional and useful as possible,&#8221; the WordPress.org representative stated.</p>\n<p>The commercial themes link has ultimately received an even more prominent placement than it had in years past and is also benefiting from the updated design. If stats remain down, it&#8217;s possible that the new design better reflects the quality of the free themes available. Satisfied users are less likely to turn to commercial options when they can easily browse and filter free options. For now, commercial theme shops listed in the directory will have to settle on improving their marketing elsewhere.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 20:30:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: What’s a Better Name for the Happiness Bar?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41227";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"http://wptavern.com/whats-a-better-name-for-the-happiness-bar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5129:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WPHappinessBarFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[41227]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41246" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WPHappinessBarFeaturedImage.png?resize=817%2C368" alt="WP Happiness Bar Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35800266@N07/9265175419">WPMTL2013happinessbar_13_LR</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve <a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">attended a WordCamp</a>, you might be familiar with the term <em>Happiness Bar</em>. It&#8217;s an area within a WordCamp venue devoted to providing technical support for WordPress. Morten Rand-Hendriksen thinks it&#8217;s time to <a title="http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/#.VRmrv4e3rqk.twitter" href="http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/#.VRmrv4e3rqk.twitter">change the name</a> to something more obvious.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most important task of giving a service a name is to ensure the name communicates what the service does to the uninitiated. The problem, which is pretty obvious, is that the name “Happiness Bar” says nothing about what is being provided. The name “Happiness Bar” is more befitting a bar where they hand out cotton candy, hugs, or free jokes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like Hendriksen, I have observed WordCamp attendees not take full advantage of the happiness bar, mostly due to not knowing what it is. It also doesn&#8217;t help when WordCamp organizers fail to mention it during opening remarks. Happiness is a subjective term and is delivered differently depending on the person. This is evident in the responses Hendriksen received when he asked attendees what the happiness bar is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Is it where they hand out swag?”</li>\n<li>“It’s a place where they give you life advice?”</li>\n<li>“It’s a desk where they have life/business/happiness coaches?”</li>\n<li>“You go there to get a massage?”</li>\n<li>“Do they give away candy?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As someone who has attended several WordCamps, I find their responses comical yet, realistic. Within the comments of Hendriksen&#8217;s post, <a title="http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/comment-page-1/#comment-1361772" href="http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/comment-page-1/#comment-1361772">Jen Mylo gives insight</a> into how the happiness bar originated.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the historical reason it was called that: It used to be Genius Bar and at SxSW an Apple person came over, smiled, and took a picture, and we were afraid we’d get sued. WCSF was coming up soon and all of the natural names like WP Help Desk etc had independent businesses attached to them, and we didn’t want to have a conflict with any small businesses.</p>\n<p>Back when Automattic ran WCSF (vs a .org community team like now), happiness bar made sense for that one event, because they were mostly Happiness Engineers and it didn’t infringe on anyone’s business. After that, other WCs wanted to copy it. I begged them not to, to just call it a help desk or something, but organizers persisted in wanting to adopt that nomenclature to be more like SF. (I didn’t use it at the WCs I organized in NYC or Savannah.)</p>\n<p>I work for Automattic so I obviously think it’s a good company, but the devotion to that name in other contexts has always bummed me out, because it doesn’t mean a damn thing to anyone unless they have already been indoctrinated with the whole &#8216;focus on happiness, not support, because the happy outcome is what we want to provide&#8217; thing, which almost no one has.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mylo finished her comment by offering feedback on Hendriksen&#8217;s suggestions for a new name and encouraged him to post his idea to the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/community" href="http://make.wordpress.org/community">Make WordPress Community</a> site to start a more official conversation.</p>\n<h2>Call The Happiness Bar The WordPress Help Center</h2>\n<p>I think the happiness bar should be renamed to something that&#8217;s generic and easy to figure out based on its title alone. My suggestion is to call it the <em>WordPress Help Center</em>. It tells people it&#8217;s a location within the venue and is a place to get WordPress help. It&#8217;s also generalized so that it covers both WordPress.com and WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The only issue I see is that, <a title="http://wphelpcenter.com/" href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">WP HelpCenter</a> used to be a service that offered WordPress tech support. However, the site and service has been defunct for a long time. Perhaps the <a title="http://wordpressfoundation.org/" href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a> can find a way to obtain the domain so the title can be used at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Do you think it&#8217;s time to rename the happiness bar to something else? If so, let us know what you would call it and why.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 19:56:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Behind the Curtain with DerpPress, WordPress’ Anonymous Satirical Twitter Account";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41207";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://wptavern.com/behind-the-curtain-with-derppress-wordpress-anonymous-satirical-twitter-account";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11270:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/derppress.png" rel="prettyphoto[41207]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/derppress.png?resize=1025%2C473" alt="derppress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41217" /></a></p>\n<p>For the past two years, the <a href="https://twitter.com/DerpPress/" target="_blank">DerpPress</a> Twitter account has been cranking out tweets to amuse followers with clever puns and subtle commentary on WordPress news and development.

At the risk of putting his/her seemingly never-ending fountain of puns in jeopardy, do we really want to know DerpPress’ real identity?</p>\n<p>As part of our continual quest to find out who is behind the account, the Tavern reached out to DerpPress for an interview. Below are unedited answers to some of our burning questions and perhaps even a few clues pointing towards the mysterious voice behind the account.</p>\n<p><strong>1. When you created the DerpPress account, what was on your mind? Did you simply hope to have a few laughs? Or were you thinking, &#8220;WordPress needs its own satirical twitter account.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Much more of the former than the latter. As I recall, the <a href="https://twitter.com/wphoneybadger" target="_blank">WP Honey Badger</a> was rather active back when I started the DerpPress account, so it wasn&#8217;t as though the WP community lacked for snarky subtweets. It wasn&#8217;t any sort of stated mission or anything &#8212; I primarily started it out as a way to gently rib bad WordPress coding practices and missteps (usermeat and such) and honestly it just evolved from there.</p>\n<p><strong>2. On Aug 2nd last year, you tweeted from what I can only assume was WordCamp NYC. To whom did you reveal yourself? How many people are aware of your true identity?</strong></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="http://t.co/eOvMkN5Inu">pic.twitter.com/eOvMkN5Inu</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; DerpPress (@DerpPress) <a href="https://twitter.com/DerpPress/status/495617532704083969">August 2, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yup, WCNYC. One person guessed it there. As for other folks who have acknowledged knowing it&#8217;s me: I know of one definite, two that I&#8217;m pretty sure have me nailed and another two who claim to know but I&#8217;m betting are guessing wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What other WordCamps have you attended?</strong></p>\n<p>Quite a few.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What do you think of WordPress competitors like Ghost?</strong></p>\n<p>Ghost minus the hype is intriguing, but I think its reliance upon Node.js is the real short-term killer for competing against WP. It&#8217;s just not possible at this stage to find a decent shared host that will let you run Node, so it&#8217;s either self-hosting or expensive &#8220;professional&#8221; tier hosting (leaving aside their own hosted solution). It&#8217;s really hard to compete against WP&#8217;s simplicity and low, low, LOW system requirements.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked into Bolt a bit, I&#8217;ve always kept at least an eye on Drupal and Joomla!, and a few of the static site generators (Leeflets, Jekyll, etc.). While I like Markdown as much as the next web copywriter, those options are still a bit too fiddly for the mass market. My noodling-about shared hosting accounts are littered with the likes of Xoops, concrete5, MODx, Melody, Habari, heck, even a Textpattern install or two.</p>\n<p>WordPress is innovating, though, and in a way that many folks seem blind to &#8212; the WP-API. The intriguing part of the WP-API is that it will (theoretically) allow multiple other projects to either integrate existing WP installs into their flow or to dramatically &#8220;re-skin&#8221; WordPress. You could potentially have a Ghost-like dashboard, completely free of WP&#8217;s legacy, all driven off the API. It&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n<p>Also, I miss having MovableType around to kick about.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Do you think that John O&#8217;Nolan characterized you unfairly in his post on <a href="http://john.onolan.org/open-source-culture/" target="_blank">open source culture</a>? Can you respond to his claims? Would you identify yourself as an open source cultural influencer?</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Conversely, it’s sad to see a sometimes disparate culture in the WordPress core community. Anonymous twitter accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/WordPreh" target="_blank">WordPreh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DerpPress" target="_blank">DerpPress</a> spend all day, every day, mostly cutting down other people and projects. It’s like a niche version of Secret app. Regular ad hominem snark directed at people both inside and outside the WordPress community.&#8221;</em> &#8211; O&#8217;Nolan</strong></p>\n<p>An influencer? I certainly hope not.</p>\n<p>I think O&#8217;Nolan really misses my point. I know that there are lots of WP ecosystem ex-pats tooling about, some with axes to grind, but I do appreciate the ones who take the time to say &#8220;This is what I see is wrong with WP and here&#8217;s some constructive feedback&#8221;.</p>\n<p>That being said, the WordPress community can occasionally exhibit behavior best described as &#8220;hero worship&#8221;. It&#8217;s honestly a great thing for &#8220;rockstars&#8221; to make themselves available, but too often we find ourselves venerating folks for their position. I definitely subtweet a good deal and I really try not to take myself too seriously. I hope others do the same. This is all good-natured ribbing. (Except for when we take shots at Joomla!. Those are deadly serious.)</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s occasionally bouts of That&#8217;s Not Funnyism that runs rampant. I suggest a mild dose of Everyone Calm Down And Laugh A Bit.</p>\n<p><strong>6.  Were you disappointed by not making Torque&#8217;s list of <a href="http://torquemag.io/100-wordpress-influencers-follow-2015/" target="_blank">100 WordPress influencers</a>?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely no one should ever listen to me about anything. Ever.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Can you recommend some strategies for becoming a better WordPress professional?</strong></p>\n<p>See point #6. But in general: you should be attending Meetups and WordCamps, making connections, following interesting WP people on Twitter (and clicking the links they share), and working with WP in your spare time, if ever you have any. The best way to get better at anything WP is to practice, and to pay attention.</p>\n<p>Also: build a time machine and go back and study WordPress&#8217; history from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Who would make a good replacement for Matt Mullenweg to lead WordPress and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Interesting question.

His new plugin works alongside caching solutions, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/" target="_blank">Batcache</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank">W3 Total Cache</a>, to enable WordPress to better serve cached pages to logged-in users.</p>\n<p>Jaquith knows just about everything there is to know about site optimization and caching techniques in WordPress. He recently gave a presentation at <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-london-2015-highlights-the-energy-in-the-uk-wordpress-scene-with-punk-wapuu-and-a-focus-on-non-profits" target="_blank">WordCamp London 2015</a>, entitled “<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/markjaquith/cache-money-business" target="_blank">Cache Money Business</a>” where he debuted the new plugin.</p>\n<p>He introduced Cache Buddy as &#8220;a companion for your WordPress page caching solution.&#8221; Ordinarily, when WordPress is serving pages to logged-in users or those with comment cookies, it cannot cache pages, even with popular caching plugins in place. Cache Buddy steps in to fill in the gap, allowing WordPress to serve a cached page to logged-in users by performing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changes what paths logged-in cookies are set for (so they work in the WordPress backend, but don’t exist on the front of the site).</li>\n<li>Sets custom cookies with relevant information about the logged-in user, on the front of the site, making these cookies JavaScript-readable.</li>\n<li>Sets custom cookies for commenters (again, JavaScript-readable), and doesn’t set the normal WordPress comment cookies.</li>\n<li>Uses the information from these JavaScript cookies, plus some comment form magic, to recreate the comment form experience users would get from a dynamic page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By cutting down on the number of dynamic views (cache misses), the load on your sever is dramatically decreased. The toolbar will be hidden from Subscriber and Contributor users, but Authors, Editors, and Administrators will still see the toolbar and get dynamic views.</p>\n<p>Cache Buddy is ideal for sites that already have a caching solution in place and get lots of traffic but have no strict requirements on providing dynamic views. Jaquith summarized the kinds of sites for which Cache Buddy will not be useful:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you have a BuddyPress site or an e-commerce site, you may honestly need WordPress logged-in cookies available on the front of your site. But if you’re just running a blog/CMS site with a significant number of commenters and logged-in Subscribers, this plugin could massively speed up your site, because requests that had to always be dynamic before, can now be served from a page cache.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-buddy/" target="_blank">Cache Buddy</a> is available to download for free from WordPress.org. To learn more about how it works, check out Jaquith&#8217;s <a href="https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/cache-buddy/" target="_blank">post introducing the plugin</a>, as well as his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/markjaquith/cache-money-business" target="_blank">slides</a> from WordCamp London 2015.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 04:07:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"Post Status: Andrew Nacin has joined the White House’s U.S. Digital Service";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=12083";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://poststatus.com/andrew-nacin-has-joined-the-white-houses-u-s-digital-service/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6238:"<p>Andrew Nacin hasn&#8217;t worked at <a href="http://audrey.co/">Audrey Capital</a> since January. At Audrey, he has worked for more than four years for WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, exclusively on the WordPress project. He has <a href="http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/">joined the White House’s new U.S. Digital Service</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">The U.S. Digital Service</a> is a new organization that operates from the White House, with an aim to modernize and transform the way the federal government operates digitally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I was approached, I have to admit that I was nervous to step back from the day-to-day buzz of WordPress because I’ve invested so much. But the community stepped up, in most cases not even knowing about my life change. That’s the beauty of open source, and the fantastic WordPress community in particular. WordPress continues to play an important role in my life. With <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a>’s support and encouragement, I’m taking time away from Audrey, where I’ve worked since 2010. I’m still actively involved in the project, just not full time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those that are aware of WordPress core development and Nacin’s role in it, know that he’s enormously influential on the project. He’s lead developer for WordPress and has worked full-time or more than full-time exclusively on WordPress for years. He lead WordPress 3.5, 3.7, and 3.9 in a span of two years. In 2014, Nacin spent a lot of time on security related projects, and he&#8217;s always been heavily involved in a variety of WordPress.org website projects.</p>\n<h3>The year of delegation</h3>\n<p>Nacin spent much of 2014 attempting to make himself replaceable. No software project is healthy if there is one person that is so indispensable that if they were no longer involved the project would be severely burdened.</p>\n<p>From security, to internationalization efforts, to leading releases, to managing the WordPress.org website, Nacin has altered his role throughout the year to empower other contributors to do the type of work he was doing.</p>\n<p>His transfer to the U.S. Digital Service just happened to be good timing with this effort. The perfect testament is that he’s been working full time with the U.S. Digital Service since January and the large majority of the WordPress core development community has had no idea.</p>\n<p>Some may be concerned about what happens without Nacin full time on core. The answer is that “business as usual” will happen, and is already happening.</p>\n<h3>About the U.S. Digital Service</h3>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">Members of the U.S. Digital Service come from all over the country and some of the top tech companies in the world.</span> Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are among them. They work on small teams and embed into troubled federal projects to help test, triage, and transform them to success. Wired has a great in-depth article on <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/healthcare-gov/">how the organization works</a>. The team was established in the wake of the Healthcare.gov disaster, and they’re taking the success they had fixing Healthcare.gov across the government.</p>\n<p>Nacin is on one of these teams, and it’s hard to imagine a more perfect fit. Those that follow him <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">on Twitter</a> or know him in person can see his passion for government. He also lives in DC and has friends in various parts of government.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s my nature to look for the hardest problems to solve. I like to take on big challenges and spend every ounce of energy working to solve them. I believe in what we’re doing here. The stakes are high. No matter the challenge, I know what we’re doing will change millions of lives.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>A changing role</h3>\n<p>He’ll be away from Audrey for his stint in government. At some point, he may come back to Audrey and resume his work. It’s actually a preferred method of employment for many members of the U.S. Digital Service. Many of the team members are leaving lucrative jobs to work for the government, which has many restrictions that had to be overcome.</p>\n<p>They even <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/the-white-house-dickerson/">make exceptions on how they dress</a>. The program is designed for members of the U.S. Digital Service to have flexible employment, where they work for six months, or maybe a year, and then they return to the private sector. They may even rotate into the U.S. Digital Service multiple times.</p>\n<p>In his <a href="http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/">announcement post</a>, Nacin advocates for others to consider <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service#section-join">joining the U.S. Digital Service</a>. I think it would be incredible if more WordPress developers were involved at that level of government, and it would be a further testament to open source&#8217;s standing in the government community &#8212; a sector that was slow to adopt open technology but now is doing so regularly.</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developers are not always full time on WordPress. Mark Jaquith has never been full time on the project. It is more important that they can guide the project, but being a lead developer doesn’t mean writing code for WordPress every day. It means steering the ship, and that’s what Nacin and the other lead developers do day to day.</p>\n<p>I’m really excited for Nacin, and I think it’s great for the project. The amount he will learn and engage with the U.S. Digital Service will make him an even better WordPress lead developer. The U.S. Digital Service is also one of the most exciting government initiatives I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about his decision to join <a href="http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/">on his blog</a>, and learn more about the U.S. Digital Service <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service/">on their website</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href="http://kldn.net">Vladimir Petkov</a></em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 17:56:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"Andrew Nacin: I’ve joined the White House’s U.S. Digital Service";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://nacin.com/?p=4297";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6125:"<blockquote><p>The need for effective government services is rising, while confidence in our ability to deliver them is dropping.

The American people need our help and our government has asked us to serve, as <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service#section-join">doers and makers, creative thinkers, and specialized technologists dedicated to untangling, rewiring, and redesigning our government</a>.</p>\n<p>In January, I joined the U.S. Digital Service.</p>\n<p>When I was approached, I have to admit that I was nervous to step back from the day-to-day buzz of WordPress because I&#8217;ve invested so much. But the community stepped up, in most cases not even knowing about my life change. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source, and the fantastic WordPress community in particular. WordPress continues to play an important role in my life. With <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a>’s support and encouragement, I&#8217;m taking time away from Audrey, where I&#8217;ve worked since 2010. I&#8217;m still actively involved in the project, just not full time.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Digital Service is the real deal. I&#8217;ve been astounded by the impact we&#8217;ve already made. We&#8217;ve recruited <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/03/19/president-obama-names-david-recordon-director-white-house-information-technology">some</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/04/white-house-names-googles-megan-smith-the-next-chief-technology-officer-of-the-united-states/">of</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/20/day-one-mikey-dickerson-us-digital-service-administrator">the</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/18/white-house-names-dr-dj-patil-first-us-chief-data-scientist">best</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/05/next-us-chief-information-officer">and</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/why-i-joined-the-u-s-digital-service-24c6682afce2?source=latest">brightest</a>.

If you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">this video</a> yet, take a look. (A few of you have noticed me in the background.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s my nature to look for the hardest problems to solve. I like to take on big challenges and spend every ounce of energy working to solve them. I believe in what we&#8217;re doing here. The stakes are high. No matter the challenge, I know what we&#8217;re doing will change millions of lives.</p>\n<p>I thought I had made the most of my decade in D.C. I&#8217;ve witnessed a lot of history. I knew I&#8217;d have some great stories to tell my future kids and grandkids. <em>I was there. I saw it.</em> That was only the beginning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class="share-sfc-stc"><a href="http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2FpQEdq-17j&count=vertical&related=nacin&text=I''ve joined the White House''s U.S. Digital Service" class="twitter-share-button"></a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 17:25:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Andrew Nacin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: US memory championship.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44786";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2015/03/us-memory-championship/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:486:"<blockquote><p>To attain the rank of grand master of memory, you must be able to perform three seemingly superhuman feats.

According to Slack, the breach occurred during a four-day period in February.</p>\n<p>Hackers gained access to a central database used to store user names, email addresses, and one-way encrypted (“hashed”) passwords. In addition, the database contains information that users may have optionally added to their profiles such as phone number and Skype ID.</p>\n<p>Slack uses <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> with a randomly generated salt per-password that according to Slack, &#8220;makes it computationally infeasible that your password could be recreated from the hashed form.&#8221; No financial data was compromised and so far, the company hasn&#8217;t found any evidence that the hackers were able to decrypt the stored passwords.</p>\n<h2>Two New Security Options</h2>\n<p>Slack has launched two new features for individuals and team owners to help increase security. The first is <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication">Two-Factor authentication</a>. Slack has a <a title="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204509068" href="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204509068">detailed guide</a> that explains how to configure 2FA for your account. When you enable 2FA, you&#8217;ll be prompted to enter a verification code in addition to your normal password whenever you sign in.</p>\n<p>The second is a “<a title="https://my.slack.com/admin/auth#password_reset" href="https://my.slack.com/admin/auth#password_reset">Password Kill Switch</a>” for team owners. The kill switch allows for instantaneous team-wide resetting of passwords and forced termination of all user sessions for all team members. This means that everyone is signed out of your Slack team, in all apps and on all devices.</p>\n<h2>Enable 2FA Where Possible</h2>\n<p>Users are highly encouraged to enable 2FA on Slack and on any other service that supports it.

We need a way for plugins to provide a notice upon activation that shows what to do next.</li>\n<li>Since the menu isn’t updated, users still need to do a page refresh in order for the changes to actually go in effect and for them to use the features of many plugins.</li>\n<li>There are plugins such as maintenance mode ones that users will not want to be activated right away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The idea of installing plugins inline is sound, but until the user experience issues are addressed, the plugin install process will remain the same.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 20:50:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 185 – Turning The Page With Joshua Strebel";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=41184&preview_id=41184";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-185-turning-the-page-with-joshua-strebel";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2714:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a title="http://marcuscouch.com/" href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I are joined by Joshua Strebel, CEO of <a title="https://pagely.com/" href="https://pagely.com/">Pagely</a>.

(42, 1, '2015-03-03 19:11:07', '2015-03-03 19:11:07', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mnm-n', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:21:33', '2015-04-09 06:21:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/?p=42', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(77, 1, '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '2015-03-11 12:50:30', '', 42, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/77', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(78, 2, '2015-04-08 12:57:15', '2015-04-08 12:57:15', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(81, 1, '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\n\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\n\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\n\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\n\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '2015-03-12 14:40:20', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/81', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic.

In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-11 22:25:29', '2015-03-11 22:25:29', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/89', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(90, 2, '2015-03-12 07:45:26', '2015-03-12 07:45:26', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability.

The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 07:49:08', '2015-03-12 07:49:08', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/93', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nHawking doesn’t discover a unified equation, but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (“A Brief History of Time” has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 08:23:12', '2015-03-12 08:23:12', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/96', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(97, 1, '2015-03-12 09:29:11', '2015-03-12 09:29:11', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed.

Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow.

The movie is a love story and a success story, ending with Hawking’s refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, for reasons that aren’t explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby, and dominates him. After one brief outburst, Jane doesn’t protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves: Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? “The Theory of Everything” makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.', 'Interstellar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-12 14:29:09', '2015-03-12 14:29:09', '', 78, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/99', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(100, 1, '2015-03-12 14:29:41', '2015-03-12 14:29:41', 'Interstellar,” an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolan’s 2010 movie, “Inception,” offered layers of dreaming consciousness, each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless—a postmodern machine, with many moving parts, dedicated to its own workings and little else. In “Interstellar,” however, Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies, “Interstellar” begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing, the oxygen is decreasing, and, after a worldwide crop failure, dust storms coat the Midwest, drying out the corn, the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game, and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole, a tunnel in space-time, providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond.\r\n\r\nThe commander of an underground NASA outpost, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), sends a favored pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission: Cooper and his crew, including Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earth’s billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage, with its altered space-time continuum, they testily debate one another, referring, in passing, to theories advanced by Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Kip Thorne. (Thorne, a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawking’s, served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.\r\n\r\nNolan, who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies, must love the dark. In “Interstellar,” he and the designer, Nathan Crowley, and the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, send Cooper’s ship, the Endurance, hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere, or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black, and much of it is stirringly beautiful. There’s no doubting Nolan’s craft. Throughout “Interstellar,” the camera remains active, pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting—in particular, the crew’s rough-ride stress—is exciting from moment to moment, but, over all, “Interstellar,” a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots, the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin, but George Lucas’s boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubrick’s impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far, far away.\r\n\r\nCooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe belief that love, as much as gravity, holds galaxies together, may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking, but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. “The Theory of Everything” tells the story of Hawking and his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963, when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party, he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is studying “arts,” as she says, and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create “one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe.” But an earlier scene, in which he races a friend around a field, shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses, Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall, after which he retreats to his room, listening over and over to Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years, but Jane, tougher than a British Army officer, marries him and keeps him going.\r\n\r\nThe couple went on to have three children. In one scene, a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him, “Does your disease affect, you know, everything?” Hawking, who is still able to speak a little, says, “Different system.” The film, at its best, doesn’t mince words or scenes about Hawking’s disability. It’s also a revelatory portrait of his strength, including his surprising gaiety, the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie, his illness and his productivity are intimately linked.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses.

In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like.

(135, 1, '2015-03-12 23:15:49', '2015-03-12 23:15:49', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic.

(137, 1, '2015-03-12 23:16:50', '2015-03-12 23:16:50', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month.

That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(153, 1, '2015-03-15 11:40:12', '2015-03-15 11:40:12', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-15 11:40:12', '2015-03-15 11:40:12', '', 42, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/153', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou''s routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he''s there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Nightcrawler2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that "Nightcrawler" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it''s the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but "Nightcrawler" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\r\n\r\n"Nightcrawler," in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year''s "Prisoners," plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahowny," showing his character''s complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn''t be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal''s Lou in a role that could''ve been an empty, and even distracting, side role.

(170, 2, '2015-03-15 21:47:12', '2015-03-15 21:47:12', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(173, 2, '2015-02-05 22:27:53', '2015-02-05 22:27:53', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage.

(179, 2, '2015-03-15 22:29:27', '2015-03-15 22:29:27', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war).

(182, 2, '2015-03-15 22:42:53', '2015-03-15 22:42:53', '"Nightcrawler" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don''t detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou''s routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he''s there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Nightcrawler2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that "Nightcrawler" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it''s the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but "Nightcrawler" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\r\n\r\n"Nightcrawler," in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year''s "Prisoners," plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahowny," showing his character''s complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn''t be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal''s Lou in a role that could''ve been an empty, and even distracting, side role.

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death.

It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride ''Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai'' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-165" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2-1024x427.jpg" alt="Kill-Bill2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis film''s a sampling of the Tarantino ''fury,'' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

(187, 1, '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.\r\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece.', 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '173-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '2015-03-16 22:12:30', '', 173, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/187', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou''s routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news.

Many of the touted cameos which include Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe play a small part in the plot, but a lot of them are underused. The talented Saoirse Ronan I felt was particularly underused. The intricate and complicated plot felt tiresome towards the end as so much takes place and the dialogue is so quick and sharp, that if you miss a line, you will miss a big part of the plot. It started to feel too cluttered as there were too many people in it and too much happening. It is still consistently funny and dazzling, but lacked emotional involvement that it felt slightly empty. I think personally, I still pine for Wes Anderson''s more melancholic tones of ''The Royal Tenembaums'' and ''Rushmore''. In those films, I cared more for the characters and enjoyed the visual and quirky style. I feel his films are drifting towards a more silly and farcical tone, which is fine, but in my opinion I don''t feel it is for the better.', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-grand-budapest-hotel', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:44:03', '2015-04-09 06:44:03', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/?p=195', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well.

At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times.

While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers.

She steals every scene she''s in.\r\n\r\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children''s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2-1024x683.jpg" alt="jagten2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund''s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer''s imagination, which chill to the bone.\r\n\r\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn''t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"The Hunt" was easily the saddest film I''ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It''s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that''s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but "The Hunt" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I''ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.', 'Jagten', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'jagten', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/?p=206', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children''s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2-1024x683.jpg" alt="jagten2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund''s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer''s imagination, which chill to the bone.\r\n\r\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn''t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"The Hunt" was easily the saddest film I''ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It''s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that''s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but "The Hunt" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I''ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.', 'Jagten', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '206-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '2015-03-22 09:47:30', '', 206, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/209', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In his new film, ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' he tightly weaves together a crime caper that is sharp, witty and slick, but sadly lacks interesting characters.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grand-budapest-hotel2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-203" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grand-budapest-hotel2-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Grand Budapest Hotel - 64th Berlin Film Festival" /></a>\r\n\r\nI won''t go too far in explaining the plot because a lot happens in the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. The narrative is rather complex as it is handed down from Tom Wilkinson who plays the author who hands the story to his younger self played by Jude Law, who then speaks to Mr Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who then tells Jude Law his times of when he got a job as a Lobby Boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, working for the eccentric perfectionist M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). We then move from the run down Hotel of that time to the 1930′s when the hotel was booming. We see the hotel in a wedding cake style aesthetic, where anyone who is anyone in the aristocratic world comes to stay, and alt of the time, sleep with Gustave. This includes elderly aristocrat Madame D (An unrecognisable Tilda Swinton). When Madame D dies, she leaves Gustave a priceless painting ''Boy with Apple'', to the disgust of Madame D''s greedy family, especially her conniving son Dimitri (Adrien Brody). This starts off a chain events which involve lawyers and hit men, an elaborate prison break, a secret society, a woman who hides things in her detailed cakes, and unspecified war and much more.\r\n<blockquote>Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead.

It adopts the aesthetic which has become the signature of Wes Anderson films. The perfect framing, the elaborate set design, the costumes matching the sets and all the quirkiness and eccentric deadpan humour to boot. Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead. His sense of timing and delivery is perfect. Also, his character is very interesting as he initially comes across as a self serving eccentric, but as the film goes on, you realise he has a lot of good in him. Unfortunately, I felt he was the only interesting character in it. Many of the touted cameos which include Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe play a small part in the plot, but a lot of them are underused. The talented Saoirse Ronan I felt was particularly underused. The intricate and complicated plot felt tiresome towards the end as so much takes place and the dialogue is so quick and sharp, that if you miss a line, you will miss a big part of the plot. It started to feel too cluttered as there were too many people in it and too much happening. It is still consistently funny and dazzling, but lacked emotional involvement that it felt slightly empty. I think personally, I still pine for Wes Anderson''s more melancholic tones of ''The Royal Tenembaums'' and ''Rushmore''. In those films, I cared more for the characters and enjoyed the visual and quirky style. I feel his films are drifting towards a more silly and farcical tone, which is fine, but in my opinion I don''t feel it is for the better.', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '195-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-07 16:03:21', '2015-04-07 16:03:21', '', 195, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/226', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I''ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers.

That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses.

(230, 2, '2015-04-07 16:04:00', '2015-04-07 16:04:00', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like. The reviews were all about Kubrick, like I wasn''t there."\r\n\r\nLike she wasn''t there.', 'The shining', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-07 16:04:00', '2015-04-07 16:04:00', '', 42, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/230', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(231, 2, '2015-04-07 16:04:18', '2015-04-07 16:04:18', '"Nightcrawler" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don''t detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou''s routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he''s there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Nightcrawler2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that "Nightcrawler" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it''s the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but "Nightcrawler" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\r\n\r\n"Nightcrawler," in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year''s "Prisoners," plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahowny," showing his character''s complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn''t be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal''s Lou in a role that could''ve been an empty, and even distracting, side role. The entire project is rich in commentary, performances, and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete films of the year.', 'Nightcrawler', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-07 16:04:18', '2015-04-07 16:04:18', '', 159, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/archives/231', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride ''Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai'' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-165" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2-1024x427.jpg" alt="Kill-Bill2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis film''s a sampling of the Tarantino ''fury,'' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

(233, 2, '2015-04-07 16:04:43', '2015-04-07 16:04:43', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama.

In his new film, ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' he tightly weaves together a crime caper that is sharp, witty and slick, but sadly lacks interesting characters.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grand-budapest-hotel2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-203" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grand-budapest-hotel2-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Grand Budapest Hotel - 64th Berlin Film Festival" /></a>\r\n\r\nI won''t go too far in explaining the plot because a lot happens in the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. The narrative is rather complex as it is handed down from Tom Wilkinson who plays the author who hands the story to his younger self played by Jude Law, who then speaks to Mr Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who then tells Jude Law his times of when he got a job as a Lobby Boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, working for the eccentric perfectionist M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). We then move from the run down Hotel of that time to the 1930′s when the hotel was booming. We see the hotel in a wedding cake style aesthetic, where anyone who is anyone in the aristocratic world comes to stay, and alt of the time, sleep with Gustave. This includes elderly aristocrat Madame D (An unrecognisable Tilda Swinton). When Madame D dies, she leaves Gustave a priceless painting ''Boy with Apple'', to the disgust of Madame D''s greedy family, especially her conniving son Dimitri (Adrien Brody). This starts off a chain events which involve lawyers and hit men, an elaborate prison break, a secret society, a woman who hides things in her detailed cakes, and unspecified war and much more.\r\n<blockquote>Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead.

It adopts the aesthetic which has become the signature of Wes Anderson films. The perfect framing, the elaborate set design, the costumes matching the sets and all the quirkiness and eccentric deadpan humour to boot. Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead. His sense of timing and delivery is perfect. Also, his character is very interesting as he initially comes across as a self serving eccentric, but as the film goes on, you realise he has a lot of good in him. Unfortunately, I felt he was the only interesting character in it. Many of the touted cameos which include Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe play a small part in the plot, but a lot of them are underused. The talented Saoirse Ronan I felt was particularly underused. The intricate and complicated plot felt tiresome towards the end as so much takes place and the dialogue is so quick and sharp, that if you miss a line, you will miss a big part of the plot. It started to feel too cluttered as there were too many people in it and too much happening. It is still consistently funny and dazzling, but lacked emotional involvement that it felt slightly empty. I think personally, I still pine for Wes Anderson''s more melancholic tones of ''The Royal Tenembaums'' and ''Rushmore''. In those films, I cared more for the characters and enjoyed the visual and quirky style. I feel his films are drifting towards a more silly and farcical tone, which is fine, but in my opinion I don''t feel it is for the better.', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '195-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:20:48', '2015-04-09 06:20:48', '', 195, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/195-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I''ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp''s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she''s in.\r\n\r\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children''s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2-1024x683.jpg" alt="jagten2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund''s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer''s imagination, which chill to the bone.\r\n\r\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn''t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"The Hunt" was easily the saddest film I''ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It''s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that''s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but "The Hunt" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I''ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.', 'Jagten', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '206-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:21:17', '2015-04-09 06:21:17', '', 206, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/206-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.

(260, 1, '2015-04-09 06:21:33', '2015-04-09 06:21:33', 'Stanley Kubrick''s cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that''s not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I''m sure she''ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She''s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict."\r\n\r\nDo people talk this way about real tragedies? Will his wife be absolutely fascinated? Does he ever tell her about it? Jack, wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) move into the vast hotel just as workers are shutting it down for the winter; the chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) gives them a tour, with emphasis on the food storage locker ("You folks can eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice"). Then they''re alone, and a routine begins: Jack sits at a typewriter in the great hall, pounding relentlessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny put together a version of everyday life that includes breakfast cereal, toys and a lot of TV. There is no sense that the three function together as a loving family.\r\n\r\nDanny: Is he reliable? He has an imaginary friend named Tony, who speaks in a lower register of Danny''s voice. In a brief conversation before the family is left alone, Hallorann warns Danny to stay clear of Room 237, where the violence took place, and he tells Danny they share the "shining," the psychic gift of reading minds and seeing the past and future. Danny tells Dick that Tony doesn''t want him to discuss such things. Who is Tony? "A little boy who lives in my mouth."\r\n\r\nTony seems to be Danny''s device for channeling psychic input, including a shocking vision of blood spilling from around the closed doors of the hotel elevators. Danny also sees two little girls dressed in matching outfits; although we know there was a two-year age difference in the murdered children, both girls look curiously old. If Danny is a reliable witness, he is witness to specialized visions of his own that may not correspond to what is actually happening in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Wendy, who for most of the movie has that matter-of-fact banality that Shelley Duvall also conveyed in Altman''s "3 Women." She is a companion and playmate for Danny, and tries to cheer Jack until he tells her, suddenly and obscenely, to stop interrupting his work. Much later, she discovers the reality of that work, in one of the movie''s shocking revelations. She is reliable at that moment, I believe, and again toward the end when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he turns violent.\r\n\r\nBut there is a deleted scene from "The Shining" (1980) that casts Wendy''s reliability in a curious light. Near the end of the film, on a frigid night, Jack chases Danny into the labyrinth on the hotel grounds. His son escapes, and Jack, already wounded by a baseball bat, staggers, falls and is seen the next day, dead, his face frozen into a ghastly grin. He is looking up at us from under lowered brows, in an angle Kubrick uses again and again in his work. Here is the deletion, reported by the critic Tim Dirks: "A two-minute explanatory epilogue was cut shortly after the film''s premiere. It was a hospital scene with Wendy talking to the hotel manager; she is told that searchers were unable to locate her husband''s body."\r\n\r\nIf Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack''s body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past, and does that explain Jack''s presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel partygoers in 1921? Did Jack''s violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy''s imagination, or Danny''s, or theirs?\r\n\r\nThe one observer who seems trustworthy at all times is Dick Hallorann, but his usefulness ends soon after his midwinter return to the hotel. That leaves us with a closed-room mystery: In a snowbound hotel, three people descend into versions of madness or psychic terror, and we cannot depend on any of them for an objective view of what happens. It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick''s film so strangely disturbing.\r\n\r\nYes, it is possible to understand some of the scenes of hallucination. When Jack thinks he is seeing other people, there is always a mirror present; he may be talking with himself. When Danny sees the little girls and the rivers of blood, he may be channeling the past tragedy. When Wendy thinks her husband has gone mad, she may be correct, even though her perception of what happens may be skewed by psychic input from her son, who was deeply scarred by his father''s brutality a few years earlier. But what if there is no body at the end?\r\n\r\nKubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Stephen King''s original novel report that Kubrick dumped many plot elements and adapted the rest to his uses. Kubrick is telling a story with ghosts (the two girls, the former caretaker and a bartender), but it isn''t a "ghost story," because the ghosts may not be present in any sense at all except as visions experienced by Jack or Danny.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them. Jack is an alcoholic and child abuser who has reportedly not had a drink for five months but is anything but a "recovering alcoholic." When he imagines he drinks with the imaginary bartender, he is as drunk as if he were really drinking, and the imaginary booze triggers all his alcoholic demons, including an erotic vision that turns into a nightmare. We believe Hallorann when he senses Danny has psychic powers, but it''s clear Danny is not their master; as he picks up his father''s madness and the story of the murdered girls, he conflates it into his fears of another attack by Jack. Wendy, who is terrified by her enraged husband, perhaps also receives versions of this psychic output. They all lose reality together. Yes, there are events we believe: Jack''s manuscript, Jack locked in the food storage room, Jack escaping, and the famous "Here''s Johnny!" as he hatchets his way through the door. But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why.\r\n\r\nKubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease. There is one take involving Scatman Crothers that Kubrick famously repeated 160 times. Was that "perfectionism," or was it a mind game designed to convince the actors they were trapped in the hotel with another madman, their director? Did Kubrick sense that their dismay would be absorbed into their performances?\r\n\r\n"How was it, working with Kubrick?" I asked Duvall 10 years after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Almost unbearable," she said. "Going through day after day of excruciating work, Jack Nicholson''s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And my character had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week. I was there a year and a month. After all that work, hardly anyone even criticized my performance in it, even to mention it, it seemed like.

The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business.

Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.\r\n<blockquote>The other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations</blockquote>\r\nUltimately, "Nightcrawler" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he''s there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nightcrawler2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Nightcrawler2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other feature "Nightcrawler" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that "Nightcrawler" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it''s the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but "Nightcrawler" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.\r\n\r\n"Nightcrawler," in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year''s "Prisoners," plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahowny," showing his character''s complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn''t be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal''s Lou in a role that could''ve been an empty, and even distracting, side role. The entire project is rich in commentary, performances, and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete films of the year.', 'Nightcrawler', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:21:39', '2015-04-09 06:21:39', '', 159, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/159-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the ''60s and ''70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It''s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.'' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie'' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride''s gory face as she''s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride ''Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai'' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-165" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kill-Bill2-1024x427.jpg" alt="Kill-Bill2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis film''s a sampling of the Tarantino ''fury,'' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It''s almost as if I''m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that''s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It''s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite ''old-school'' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there''s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\r\n\r\nEven at ''The House Of Blue Leaves'', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill''s DVAS members.'' My adrenaline''s still flowing as I''m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

(263, 1, '2015-04-09 06:21:50', '2015-04-09 06:21:50', 'Stanley Kubrick directs "Dr Strangelove." The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the "purity of his essence" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates "Attack Plan R", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a "doomsday device". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.\r\n\r\nRipper, like most of the film''s characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that "the enemy" is sapping his "sexual essence". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.\r\n\r\nGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not "masculine" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-175" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove2-1024x640.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove2" /></a>\r\n\r\nEnter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper''s sneak attack. The ball''s already rolling, he says, so let''s roll along with it. Buck''s name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).\r\n\r\nBut once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He''s President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to "work with the enemy". "Merkin" and "muff" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft''s radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick''s films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for "Purity of Essence" and "Peace on Earth", the code points to both party''s fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the "doomsday device", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it''s precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove3-1024x676.jpg" alt="Dr-Strangelove3" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore the film''s iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps "necessary" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to "fuhrers" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the "newly risen" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.\r\n<blockquote>The great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male...</blockquote>\r\nWith "Strangelove" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout.\r\n\r\nThe great black joke of "Strangelove" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film''s entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a "mating-warring association" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like "f*** you up" and "get some action" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-177" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dr-Strangelove4-1024x614.png" alt="Dr-Strangelove4" /></a>\r\n<blockquote>10/10 - Masterpiece.</blockquote>\r\nThe film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick''s camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film''s second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary "ticking clock" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film''s (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.\r\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece.', 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '173-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:21:50', '2015-04-09 06:21:50', '', 173, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/173-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(267, 1, '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '"The Hunt" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\r\n<blockquote>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath.</blockquote>\r\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I''ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I''ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen''s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won''t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp''s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she''s in.\r\n\r\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children''s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://localhost:8888/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jagten2-1024x683.jpg" alt="jagten2" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund''s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer''s imagination, which chill to the bone.\r\n\r\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn''t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"The Hunt" was easily the saddest film I''ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It''s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that''s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but "The Hunt" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I''ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.', 'Jagten', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '206-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '2015-04-09 06:49:43', '', 206, 'http://localhost:8888/wp/206-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(268, 1, '2015-04-09 06:50:42', '2015-04-09 06:50:42', 'Cooper has two children back on Earth and, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb, in “Inception,” he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia, who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover, one of the astronauts on the earlier mission, was sent, in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized, hyper-relaxed drawl, and Hathaway, with short Ph.D. hair, is crisp but also angry and passionate, and the two stars clash with professional skill. Cooper’s side of the argument sets up the movie’s finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy, the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family, including his daughter, Murph, who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears, she lashes out at him, as only Jessica Chastain can lash out, for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time, where, they assure us, love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die, but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios, Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on Jane Wilde Hawking’s 2007 memoir, “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,” which the screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, and the director, James Marsh, have made into a physically detailed and touching but, all in all, rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable: The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius, such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists, many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room, barely able to speak, has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isn’t made clear, though, how Hawking does his calculations—his work can’t be all speculation.)\r\n<blockquote>We’re puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him, after twenty-five years of loving marriage, to leave the devoted, accomplished, and beautiful Jane for a young nurse...</blockquote>\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in “Les Misérables” who sang, in a fine light tenor, the tear-stained but upbeat “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.” Tall and slender, with freckles and a flattened upper lip, he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders, he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows, his mouth, a few facial muscles, and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawking’s intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world.\r\n\r\nEddie Redmayne’s performance is astonishing, as eloquent, though in a different way, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s work in “My Left Foot.” Day-Lewis, playing the Irish artist Christy Brown, a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb, deployed his left foot, a bushy black beard, and minimal, mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man.
